    "abstract": "AbstractIn recent years, machine learning (ML) methodshave transformed computational chemistry and materials research. At the start of any machine learning inquiry we must first ask: how do we represent our system? This question is at the core of many ML methods, ranging from end-to-end methods, that take \"raw\" data formats and use multi-layer architectures to implicitly encode the chemical information to \"feature-forward\" methods, that use physics and chemistry to design numerical representations conducive to machine learning workflows. While both approaches have merits and overlaps, the latter often allows for added tunability to identify the role of key parameters in the design space and more straightforward interpretation.There are many ways to encode the raw chemical data into features, and the suitable choice largely depends on the problem at hand. For cheminformatics, string-based featurizations such as SMILES or SELFIES are popular, as they encode important parameters such as present functional groups and connectivity and can be parsed using NLP models and other text-based advancements. However, in thermodynamic contexts, where the chemistry and connectivity remains largely unchanged, such as in molecular simulation, it is more typical to use configuration-dependent features, which transform molecular coordinates into a range of suitable numerical representations.Yet, that leaves many of us that work beyond the atomic scale without many options for thermodynamic representations that reflect the complex interactions of mesoscale building blocks. Of the frameworks developed for atomic representations, density-based frameworks present the most compelling avenue for expansion. Furthermore, by defining our representations within the same conceptual framework as our atomic counterparts, we beget an ability to combine or compare representations across multiple scales, which is desperately needed for multiscale simulation and understanding and designing cross-scale phenomena.Here, we introduce and demonstrate a first-such expansion of density-based frameworks for ML representations by taking the popular SOAP (Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions) formalism and demonstrating its expansion to simple anisotropic bodies. We provide both the mathematical theory behind this expansion and demonstrate several case-studies for its usage across multiple simulation length-scales and materials systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractParticle-based simulations like molecular dynamics are ubiquitous throughout academia and industry, yet these methods suffer from several well-known limitations. One limitation is that particle-based simulations struggle to reach equilibrium when a system contains a broad spectrum of timescales, such as in polymeric materials, which often necessitates excessively long simulation times. Another limitation is that the free energy is not directly accessible in a particle-based simulation and must be computed using enhanced sampling methods. In this talk, I describe a new method that address both of these limitations. The basis for our approach is a new type of ``multi-representation'' simulation where particle and field-theoretic simulations are linked together into a unified framework. Our approach involves the construction of formally equivalent particle and field-theoretic models that are simulated subject to the constraint that their spatial density profiles are equal. This constraint provides the ability to rapidly map between particle and field-theoretic representations so that simulations can be performed in the particle/field representation where calculations are most efficient. Our approach can leverage the superior numerical properties of field-theoretic simulations to rapidly relax the largest length scales within a system and to calculate the free energy, yet can backmap into a particle-based representation when molecular configurations and dynamics are desired. Furthermore, by leveraging the formal equivalence between particle and field-based simulations, these calculations can be placed on a rigorous theoretical foundation that can be constructed without approximation. Our method is illustrated using both linear diblock copolymers and intrinsically-disordered proteins. In both cases, our method can provide direct access to the free energy, rapid equilibration, molecular configurations and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInspired by naturally occurring hierarchical materials, numerous beautiful and functional mesoscale architectures have been constructed in labs using solid-state nanoscale building blocks and bio- or biomimetic molecules via self-assembly. Their structures and assembly dynamics are tightly regulated by the system's convoluted energetics and entropic information, which may even respond to a minuscule change. For example, we recently reported a pH-regulated self-assembly of silica nanoparticles facilitated by an engineered bifunctional silica-binding protein sfGFP::Car9-Car9. The assembly and disassembly can be reversibly and cyclically modulated by alternating the solution pH between 7.5 and 8.5. In another study, we observed that an increment of the peptoid (i.e., the ligand) length by two monomers at a time would change the arrangement of a CdS quantum dot superlattice from close packing to square, further to monoclinic. However, the complexity of the nanoscale colloidal system often makes it difficult to probe the underlying physics via experimental means. Alternatively, we can construct suitable multi-scale theoretical toolkits by carefully selecting and combining theories and simulation algorithms from different levels (i.e., from ab initio to coarse-grained models) to connect the scales and gain physical insights into the assembly mechanisms. In this talk, I will elaborate on how we used multi-scale theoretical frameworks to reveal the key driving forces of self-assembly in these two cases. The knowledge we gained on the distinctive roles of organic ligands has further inspired new design principles in future studies",

Mitigation strategies are discussed for detecting the breakdown of continuum modeling at micro scales wherein Knudsen effects and other anomalous behaviors emerge. Characterization of model factor inputs and the techniques for their sourcing is described with consideration to the construction of a high throughput multi-scale shape optimized computational schema. Four objectives guided the development of this model.

The second objective was to assemble, reduce, and analyze model constants and approximations that express FEM coefficient calculations as physical forces and thermodynamic properties which could be derived from other computational methods. Third, to analyze factor sensitivity of model inputs by way of a $2^k$ factorial screening to determine which inputs are driving the physics of water harvesting adsorption systems. The fourth objective was to design the FEM solver for integration into a multi-scale high throughput topologically optimized schema.

In this work, we present a multiscale methodology which uses all-atom modeling and experimental second osmotic virial coefficients to develop coarse-grained models for flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations of hundreds of mAbs with sub-nanometer resolution. In this multiscale modeling approach, the major assumption is that mAb domains are held fixed so that their atomistic interactions with implicit solvent can be precomputed and therefore increase simulation efficiency by a few orders of magnitude. Although domains within the mAbs are rigid, the coarse-grained model includes the flexibility of the hinge region, which is often neglected but here shown to play an important role at mAb concentrations up to 150 g/L. This approach is also amenable to modeling excipients, co-formulations and surface interactions. Simulations were validated against experimental measurements and used to predict the physical stability of mAbs. These results highlight the potential for this multiscale approach to pre-screen pharmaceutical candidate mAbs in early stage development to avoid high concentration physical instabilities that can plague later stage development.",

Despite their importance, membrane proteins (MPs) represent only 2% of all protein structures in the protein data bank (PDB), and their complexes are even scarcer. Computational methods are promising tools for modeling MP interfaces and predicting complex structures. Here, we present RosettaMPDock, a flexible transmembrane protein docking protocol that captures binding induced conformational changes.To generate diversity in backbone conformations for the RosettaMPDock, we used three conformer generation methods: perturbation of the backbones along the normal modes by 1 Å, refinement using the Relax protocol, backbone flexing using the Rosetta Backrub protocol.RosettaMPDock samples large conformational ensembles of flexible monomers and docks together protein targets within an implicit membrane environment.To improve the scoring efficiency, we have used a combination of low-resolution Motif Dock Score and membrane based high-resolution score Franklin2023.RosettaMPDock is benchmarked on 30 transmembrane-protein complexes of variable flexibility dataset. Our results show RosettaMPDock successfully predicts the correct interface (success defined as achieving 3 near-native structures in the 5 top-ranked ones) for 67% of moderately flexible targets (unbound-bound backbone motion within 1.5-2.5Å) and 60% of the highly flexible targets (unbound-bound backbone motion greater than 2.5Å), a substantial improvement from the existing membrane protein docking methods.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe barrier function of the human skin is primarily located in the stratum corneum (SC), which is composed of corneocytes surrounded by a dense, lamellar lipid matrix made up of ceramides (CERs), cholesterol (CHOL), and free fatty acids (FFAs) of various lengths. While experimentalists can reproduce the lipid organization of intact SC with model systems using synthetic lipids,1the role of each lipid in the formation of the molecular structure of the SC, and hence the barrier properties of skin, is not well understood due to the complex nature of the SC lipid matrix. To address this need, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of pre-assembled lipids in primarily bilayer configurations have been used to study the behavior of the SC lipids.2However, such simulations can suffer from configurational bias due to low lipid mobility, and further, simple bilayers cannot sufficiently represent the complexity of SC multilayer structures. Thus, in order to emulate the experimental model membrane formation at long timescales and large system sizes, we developed computationally efficient coarse-grained (CG) models using the Multi-State Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (MS-IBI) method.3Here, we begin our multiscale strategy of understanding SC lamella with the CG self-assembly of large complex multilayer mixtures of multiple CERs, CHOL, and FFAs that match previously examined experimental compositions. Specifically, we go beyond the commonly studied CER NS to simulate mixtures with CERs NS, NP, AS, and AP as well as understanding the role of FFA tail length distribution. Atomistic configurations generated by back-mapping theself-assembled multi-lamellar CG configurationsprovide insights into lipid organization and structure of experimental model membranes. This multiscale approach accumulates simulation and collaborative experiments providing a holistic picture of structural properties, hydrogen bonding capabilities, and neutron scattering studies to better understand the relationship between composition of SC lipids and the barrier function of skin.References(1) Bouwstra, J.

We used iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) to parameterize the conservative potential and reproduce the structural distributions of the melt from all-atom (AA) reference simulations, and Langevin dynamics to introduce a dissipative potential as a means to recover the AA dynamics. Using this method, we found we could repair the dynamics of various diffusive measures with about a 20% variation or less in the friction parameter. Here we further our analysis this CG model by examining the influence of Langevin friction on the dynamics of the individual potentials. Various dynamic correlation functions are used to quantify and compare the dynamics of the bonded and pair potentials for the diffusion corrected CG models and the AA reference systems. This leads to an integrated approach for recovering both structure and dynamics within the scope of an IBI based parametrization by properly accounting for separate enthalpic and entropic contributions to the potentials.

    "abstract": "AbstractPolymer synthesis has become increasingly sophisticated and current developments in precise sequence-controlled polymers allow for new design opportunities. However, the enormous number of possible sequences requires robust and efficient modeling to understand and predict how sequence impacts material properties. Here, we use sequence-specific polypeptoids (a biomimetic of polypeptides) as a platform for developing design rules for relating chemical sequence to polymer conformation. Polypeptoids are particularly useful in this context due to their lack of backbone hydrogen bonding, isolating the effect of sidechain chemical sequence on polymer chain shape. Moreover, they are routinely synthesized at gram scale, sequence-specifically, with hundreds of different side chain functionalities, allowing for detailed experimental investigation and validation. Our earlier simulation studies of small polypeptoid systems with advanced sampling molecular dynamics methods examined changes in the local and global structure of short chains in response to the number and location of the hydrophobic and chiral monomers, with excellent agreement with experiments. However, to study broader chain shape effects and self-assembly behaviors, access to longer and multiple peptoid systems requires coarse-grained simulations that can exceed the limitations of atomistic simulations.Here, we develop a bottom-up coarse-grained peptoid model using the relative entropy approach to create a library of peptoid monomers suitable for studying CG models of a wide range of sequences in both long chain and self-assembly simulations. We validate our CG models with experimental end-to-end distance measurements measured from double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy. We also leverage inverse design methods to suggest sequences with unique folding and self-assembly properties into various structures as a way to investigate fundamental limits of sequence design. These new computational methods provide molecular insight into the driving forces for polymer conformation and are exciting as new in silico screening tools to guide the development of sequence-specific polymeric materials with tunable properties.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe success of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapies relies on the innate immune response, which can be modulated by small molecules to inhibit unfavorable systemic inflammation for prophylactic vaccines and improve immune stimulation for immunotherapies to mitigate suppression from tumor micro-environment. Traditional screening methods for discovering small molecule with specific pharmaceutical usages are time-consuming and resource-intensive, and often fail to identify novel compounds with high efficacy. In addition, although human intuition and experience present valuable heuristics to guide this search, the relative infancy of immunomodulator discovery efforts, absence of mechanistic understanding, and vast size of molecular space can make these heuristics limiting and subject to human preconceptions, bias, and potential blind spots.We have developed a machine learning-enabled active learning pipeline to guide in vitro experimental screening and discovery of small molecule immunomodulators that alter the signaling activity of innate immune responses stimulated by traditional pattern recognition receptor agonists. Molecules were tested by in vitro high throughput screening (HTS) where we measured modulation over the activation of two major effector of human immunity, the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB) pathway and the interferon regulatory factors (IRF) pathway. These data were used to train data-driven predictive models linking molecular structure to their immunomodulatory activity using deep representational learning, Gaussian process regression (GPR), and Bayesian optimization (BO). The deep representational learning model was trained to convert molecular structure to continuous embeddings with 97% reversible fidelity. The GPR and BO converged after four rounds of discovery loop between computation and experimentation with stabilized prediction and minimized error.By interleaving successive rounds of model training and in vitro HTS, we performed an active learning-guided traversal of a 139,998-molecule library using a fraction of the time and material costs associated with exhaustive screening. After experimentally evaluating only around 2% of the library, we discovered molecules with unprecedented immunomodulatory capacity, including those capable of suppressing NF-κB activity by up to 15-fold, elevating NF-κB activity by up to 5-fold, and elevating IRF activity by up to 3-fold. A subset of our top-performing candidates, namely 17 compounds, was tested to validate their immunomodulatory effect by measuring cytokine release profiles. One of these molecules demonstrated a 40-fold enhancement in IFN-β production. In addition, we rationalized the correlation between the chemical structure and immunomodulatory capacity by using a linear regression model and interpretable molecular features and discovered design rules for immunomodulators.Our machine learning-enabled screening approach presents an efficient immunomodulator discovery pipeline that has furnished a library of novel small molecules with unprecedented capacity to enhance or suppress innate immune signaling pathways. This has the potential to improve prophylactic vaccination by minimizing side effects and addressing vaccination hesitancy, and to enhance the potency of immunotherapies. This collection of new small molecule immunomodulators may progress to subsequent screenings, in vivo studies, clinical trials, and eventually become a pharmaceutical product, if successful. Furthermore, this machine learning-based screening strategy can be employed in drug discovery and development, especially in pipelines lacking well-defined mechanistic insights and requiring expensive experimental assessments.",

For these complex, viscous mixtures, the titration process is carried out manually in a painstakingly slow trial-and-error process by experienced industrial scientists. Herein, we accelerate the pH adjustment process by i) building a new robotic platform capable of titrating these challenging viscous formulations, ii) developing further the active machine learning (ML)-driven pH adjustment strategy presented by Pomberger et al., 2023. The platform's novel design with a 3d-printed overhead stirrer and pH probe in a single position facilitates the titration of viscous samples. Additionally, a washing station involving a soak & jetting down in isopropyl alcohol enables full automation as the robot moves between the closed-loop pH adjustment of different samples. Consumer products are typically titrated with citric acid, as this weak, polyprotic acid can confer the final product a strong buffering effect to remain at the target pH, resulting in a longer shelf-life. However, the prior literature has only developed an ML strategy compatible with strong-strong acid/base titrant pairs. Here a weak-strong acid/base pair is considered, where the deprotonation state of the weak acid depends on the pH, and there is a possibility of forming a complex buffer solution if the target pH is overshot. Accordingly, a data-driven approach (Gaussian Process regression) is combined with physical chemistry to present a hybrid model capable of efficiently guiding the robotic platform to the target pH.

    "abstract": "AbstractAutomation in many of the experimental pipelines both at laboratory and central facilities has shifted the bottleneck to autonomously-driven data analysis and decision-making. Exponential growth in tools available for data-driven modeling resulted in the advent of self-driven laboratories (SDL) that aims to automate and accelerate the entire workflow starting from synthesis to characterization and device integration for emerging technologies and energy needs. Platforms based on solution-processible materials (polymers, colloids, and nanoparticles) are amenable to automation both at the synthesis and characterization levels. Techniques such as scattering and spectroscopy provide faster high-throughput alternatives to capture a signal of the underlying structure allowing us to construct composition-structure phase maps. Although obtaining a structure phase map from high throughput structural characterization data is a decade-old problem, many of the state-of-the-art approaches are not generalizable beyond their initial application in X-ray diffraction. In particular, small-angle scattering (SAS) used to probe the structure of nanoscale material results in a continuous signal where the key information is not just in peak positions but also the overall ‘shape’ of the curve. Thus, self-driven laboratories for soft materials should be equipped with tools that can process the shape of SAS curves into useful information for decision-making and optimization. In this talk, we present a novel approach that uses Riemannian metric geometry to develop a shape-based measure for analyzing SAS curves. We use this novel analysis tool in an SDL to build a phase map of the block copolymer system in an iterative closed-loop fashion. Our approach allows the decision-making to be built on top of multiple Riemannian metric fields each corresponding to an order parameter of the phase map. Using a case study of a novel polymer blend, we show that the learned order parameters are continuous and thus have an interpretation in terms of multi-phase transitions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMolecular discovery is a constrained multi-objective optimization problem that aims to identify one or more molecules that balance multiple, often competing, properties. One approach to molecular design is to evaluate the properties of all molecules in a virtual library (“virtual screening”), and methods based on active learning and Bayesian optimization have previously been proposed to accelerate virtual screening [1, 2]. However, these methods typically consider single-objective optimization only or, in the case of multi-objective optimization, combine properties of interest into a scalarized objective [3]. A promising alternative to scalarization is Pareto optimization, which can elucidate the trade-offs between objectives and does not rely on assumptions about the relative importance of objectives. In the context of molecular discovery, Pareto optimization identifies the molecules that optimally balance multiple desired properties, revealing the best that is possible in the objective space.We combine Pareto optimization and Bayesian optimization methods to efficiently search a library of millions of molecules and identify those that optimally balance multiple objectives. Using graph neural networks as the surrogate model architecture, we apply this methodology to identify (1) dual inhibitors which minimize docking scores to two targets and (2) selective small molecule inhibitors which minimize docking scores to an on-target and maximize those to an off-target. We compare optimization performance between Pareto and scalarization acquisition functions and find that multi-objective acquisition functions outperform scalarization. This improvement is greater for the selective inhibitor task due to stronger competition between the objectives. Finally, we find that encouraging molecular and functional diversity during acquisition does not improve the hypervolume of acquired molecules but does increase the diversity of the acquired set.[1] Gentile, F.; Agrawal, V.; Hsing, M.; Ton, A.-T.; Ban, F.; Norinder, U.; Gleave, M.

    "abstract": "AbstractAcquiring accurate 3D geometries of reactive chemical species and transition states (TS) along reaction pathways over the potential energy surface is a critical prerequisite for computing high-quality thermodynamic and kinetic parameters via quantum chemistry and statistical mechanics. These calculated thermo-kinetic parameters are essential for creating impactful predictive models that can assist pharmaceutical design, high-performance material development, and renewable energy research. However, the search for transition states has historically been a trial-and-error process that demands considerable manual input. Although automated TS search has a rich history of algorithmic development, existing methods like single-ended and double-ended approaches are often computationally demanding, have high failure rates, and are highly localized to specific reaction systems, making it challenging to learn from previous examples and enhance performance. Therefore, efficiently automating the TS search is essential for enabling high-throughput chemical reactivity discovery and streamlining the generation of extensive theoretical reaction datasets that are valuable for developing machine-learning-based chemistry surrogate models. In this presentation, we introduce QuantumPioneer, a self-evolving machine capable of automatically generating validated 3D electronic structures for a given reaction using atom-mapped SMILES as input. QuantumPioneer can enhance its performance over time by learning from past experiences and can be seamlessly integrated into an active learning loop for closed-loop chemical discovery. Moreover, QuantumPioneer can be tailored to specific chemical-exploration tasks and generate extensive theoretical reaction datasets that lay the foundation for future studies with wide-ranging applications. To showcase its capabilities, we employed QuantumPioneer to generate TS at ωB97XD/def2svp level of theory for over 100,000 hydrogen atom abstraction (HAbs) reactions between peroxyl radicals and a diverse set of organic molecules chosen based on their functional groups. This dataset represents one of the largest DFT TS collections for radical-based reactions to date, laying the foundation for future studies with wide-ranging applications. We further refined the dataset with COSMO-RS and DLPNO-CCSD(T1)-F12D single-point calculations and trained D-MPNN models to predict HAbs reaction barriers. We will demonstrate how the machine learning model for HAbs barrier height prediction can potentially be applied to conduct high-throughput virtual screening of oxidative stability of organic molecules and aid better design of high-value chemicals such as active pharmaceutical ingredients and carbon capture amines.",

    "abstract": "AbstractClostridioides difficileinfection is the leading cause of diarrhea and colitis (inflammation of the colon) in North America and Europe. The fraction of the population infected by the disease is increasing as new strains associated with significant morbidity and mortality have appeared. There is a growing concern about the failure of the first line of treatment forC. diff.infection (metronidazole and vancomycin) and thus, current attention is focused on the need for alternative treatment options like biologic drugs which are safer and more efficacious. A viable and cost-effective strategy is to develop targeted peptide-based therapeutics that prevent and treatC. diff.infections by deactivating the pathogen while leaving the resident gut microbiota unharmed.During infection, theC. diff.pathogen produces two large virulent toxins (toxins A and B) that share 71% sequence homology. The glucosyltransferase domain (GTD) of these toxins acts by binding uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose, hydrolyzing it into glucose and UDP, and attaching the glucose monomer to the human Rho family of GTPases. Glycosylation of the GTPases by toxin A and toxin B GTDs leads to disruption of the cytoskeleton, apoptosis, and death of the colon epithelial cells.The objective of this project is to computationally design peptide inhibitors that bind with high affinity and specificity toC. diff.toxin A GTD and toxin B GTD to inhibit its activity. We use an automatedPeptideBindingDesign (PepBD) algorithm developed in our lab to design peptide sequences that bind toC. diff.Toxin A. Our peptide search algorithm employs Monte Carlo methods, self-consistent mean-field theory, and the concerted rotation (CONROT) technique to search for peptides in sequence and conformation space that bind to a target protein. The starting input structure for the algorithm requires a reference ligand, which is usually an experimentally determined peptide sequence that has a good binding affinity to the target protein.We identified an 8-mer peptide, SA1, that binds to theClostridioides difficiletoxin A GTD. The efficacy of peptide SA1 was tested using a trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay on monolayers of the human gut epithelial culture model. Peptide SA1 blocks TcdA toxicity in jejunum (small intestine) cells and in colon epithelial cells and exhibits a binding affinity in the nanomolar range. Next, we designed peptides that bind to toxin B GTD. Preliminary experimental data suggest that two of ourin-silicoidentified peptides, SB2 and SB6, are inhibiting glycosylation of toxin B GTD with an IC50 in the micromolar range. Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential of our computational peptide design protocol to identify peptide-based inhibitors that can treatClostridoides difficileinfection and other infectious pathogens in the future.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe discovery of new materials with desired properties is important because it can lead to significant advancements in technology and applications. Moreover, the discovery of these new materials tends to have properties that are hard to coexist with or have a very high or low value of specific properties. For example, in the case of transparent electrodes, two properties, transparent and electric, are challenging to exist simultaneously. Here, the problem is that in contrast to conventional materials, few (or any) known samples exhibit these characteristics. Because of this, chemists find it challenging to gain insights or knowledge from the existing materials that might be used to derive the molecular structures of the desired materials.In recent years, machine learning has provided a new methodology for screening novel materials with high performance, developing quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) and other models, predicting the properties of materials, and finding new materials [1]. However, since most machine learning-based models are probability distribution-based models, such as conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) [2] and conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) [3], there is a limit to finding materials with extreme characteristic values, since there are very few corresponding molecular samples. In contrast, reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning which learns policy (or order of action) that maximizes reward among selectable actions. Unlike probability distribution-based models, reinforcement learning relies solely on the reward, so it does not matter if a few existing molecules satisfy the target property. Combinatorial chemistry is a methodology that can generate a large number of molecules by combining fragments according to chemical rules. An example of combinatorial chemistry is the Breaking of retrosynthetically interesting chemical substructures (BRICS) [4]. Applying the BRICS rule, molecules can be broken into fragments, or new molecular structures can be generated by combining those fragments.In this study, we present reinforcement learning to provide combinatorial chemistry a strategy for choosing molecular fragments that directs the molecule that is generated toward the target. With a randomly selected initial fragment, our model selects the next fragment to be combined, considering the chemical rule so that the model can only generate chemically valid molecules. The policy is learned by giving a higher reward if the target properties are satisfied. This learned policy efficiently searches large chemical spaces using combinatorial chemistry. We empirically showed that our model is suitable for discovering novel materials by conducting experiments on several cases, and compared the result with two probability distribution-learning models, conditional recurrent neural network (cRNN) [5] and generative chemical transformer (GCT) [6]. Moreover, after showing that our model performs well by implementing it to a simple problem, we discuss how to improve the performance of the reinforcement learning model and implement the model in real-world problems.[1] Liu, Y., et al.,Materials discovery and design using machine learning.Journal of Materiomics, 2017.3(3): p. 159-177.[2] Sohn, K., H.

    "abstract": "AbstractRare earth elements (REE), or lanthanides, are critical materials with a wide range of applications in clean energy industrysuch as battery, semiconductor, and electric vehicles, due to their unique luminescent, magnetic, and catalytic properties. Therefore, there is a growing demand for developing green industrial-scale extraction of lanthanides. However, efficient separation of heavy lanthanides (e.g. from Europium to Lutetium) with exceedingly similar chemical properties is technologically challenging, and is an active area of research. Here, we combine molecular dynamics (MD), enhanced sampling, and machine learning methods to design insilico short 17-residue peptides that selectively bind to trivalent REE cations in aqueous solution. The REE-peptide binding affinity are predicted by ML models that are trained on features that characterize the REE-peptide binding complex including hydration properties of REEs from literature studies, REE-peptide interaction energies obtained from MD simulations, and physicochemical properties of the peptide estimated from the DBAASP peptide database. Starting from the original lanthanide-binding tag (LBT) peptide, we computationally screen peptide candidates with mutations mainly on the six key ligating residues that improve predicted binding selectivity against 12 different REEs. Candidates with top selectivity scores selected from in silico discovery are verified by the fluorescence titration experiments. Moreover, we utilize a novel genetic algorithm framework to iteratively guide the design of new peptide sequences combining our model and experiments. Therefore, we demonstrate an integrated data-driven approach for quantitative sequence-structure-activity relationship as well as design of lanthanide binding peptides, paving the road for designing novel biomolecules for efficient rare earth elements recovery.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe discovery of functional materials has traditionally been driven by chemists’ intuition and manual experimentation; the automation of the design-make-test-analyze (DMTA) cycle presents a promising alternative for accelerating multi-functional materials discovery.Integrating advancements in automatization and machine learning (ML), we developed a closed-loop, autonomous molecular discovery platform to both accelerate hit-to-lead (exploration) and lead-optimization (exploitation) workflows for molecules with multiple desired properties. The platform was designed for general chemistry with general, adaptable synthesis, workup, isolation, and characterization protocols. These capabilities can accommodate the diversity of molecules and multi-step syntheses recommended by its molecular generation and retrosynthesis algorithms. We demonstrate this platform in exploration and exploitation case studies without human intervention (beyond providing consumables and error recovery) on dye-like molecules targeting wavelength of maximum absorption, water–octanol partitioning, and photo-oxidative stability.In the exploration study, the platform, guided by property-prediction ML models, automatically performed three iterations of the DMTA cycle. Using inexpensive syntheses to diverse targets as its means to explore and learn the structure–function space of four rarely reported scaffolds, the platform realized 312 unreported molecules and substantially improved the predictions of the guiding property-prediction models in these local chemical spaces. In the exploitation study, the same platform leveraged models trained on pre-existing examples of a fifth scaffold to discover 6 top-performing molecules within their structure–property space.The platform demonstrates the potential for automated platforms which integrate the steps of the molecular discovery cycle (prediction, synthesis, measurement, and model retraining) to autonomously understand a local chemical space to aid in the discovery of functional molecules. As the components of this automated DMTA cycle are modular, with alternate property or retrosynthesis models, additional functionalities could be explored, such as biological activity, requiring only the deployment of the corresponding characterization hardware and/or protocols.This platform is the culmination of many collaborators across multiple laboratories, and as such, this presentation will focus on the design of the experimental platform and its integration with its governing models to achieve autonomous operation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPurpose:Liposomes are vesicles composed of a lipid bilayer and/or a concentric series of multiple bilayers commonly used as carriers for drug delivery purposes. In contrast to the conventional pathway of cell uptake, previous studies have proposed that fusogenic liposomes have the advantages of fusing with the cell membrane and directly releasing the cargo to the cytosol. However, there is a lack of deep understanding of the structural impact of the individual lipid on its assemblies, and uncovering the driving force that differentiates the route of the cellular uptake has been challenging. Here, we implemented coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations to predict the physicochemical properties of new lipids, simulate their propensity to self-assemble into liposomes, and determine the correlation between liposome size and lipid structural properties.Methods:The CG-MD simulations were implemented using the GROMACS software package with the MARTINI 3.0 force fields, and the trajectory analyses were conducted using MDAnalysis and PackMem. The all-atom model of examined new lipids, which composed of an amino acid-based head group, a spacer group, and two alkyl tail groups of various lengths, was first constructed using the webserver LigParGen. The new lipid model was then mapped and parameterized into the coarse-grained model. The constructed new CG lipid model was energy-minimized with the steepest descent algorithm, followed by a 10 ns equilibration in an isothermal−isochoric ensemble at ambient temperature. The cubic simulation system of various sizes (10 nm3, 25 nm3, 50 nm3, and 100 nm3) was built as mixture of water and randomly distributed lipids. The 200-ns simulation production runs were performed in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble using the Nosé−Hoover thermostat and the Parrinello−Rahman barostat at a pressure of 1 bar. The simulations were carried out using periodic boundary conditions in a 20-fs time step and the final trajectory was extracted for further physicochemical property analysis. All computations were performed using the High-Performance Computing (HPC) Supercomputer Cluster at Genentech.Results:The CG-MD simulations indicate that the examined lipids self-assemble into liposomes and micelles of various shapes and sizes within 100ns into the production run. Analysis of the radius of gyration showed that all liposomes formed were initially unstable and experienced significant fluctuations in their morphology. During this early stage, the liposomes usually transitioned from an elongated shape to an elliptical shape, eventually stabilizing into a mostly spherical shape that persisted for the duration of the simulation. Furthermore, the simulations showed that the thickness of fusogenic liposome bilayer was influenced by only certain types of amino acid head group, while the length of the spacer and the alkyl tail groups influence the liposome bilayer thickness independently from the head group. The curvature analysis provided detailed insights into the behavior of the membrane bilayer, revealing that the inner monolayer was more curved than the outer monolayer. The evaluation of three-dimensional packing defects in the membrane bilayer showed that liposome formation in this study was characterized by more deep defects than shallow defects, which indicates the regions where the hydrophobic lipid tails are transiently exposed to the aqueous polar environment leading to unstable liposomal structure. The simulation findings will be further validated through experimental studies using the same fusogenic lipids.Conclusions:While the simulation exercises did not accurately replicate the experimental particle size, potentially due to computational limitations, they still effectively uncovered the mechanism behind the formation of liposomes and their structural properties using newly designed fusogenic lipids with varying head groups, spacer lengths, and tail lengths. The MD computational platform developed in this study has proven to be a powerful tool that can help to facilitate the synthesis and testing of fusogenic lipids with specific desired properties. Not only this, but it is also capable of guiding the interpretation, explanation, and direction of experimental studies in this area.Keywords:Fusogenic liposomes, Molecular dynamics simulations, Coarse-grained, Membrane defects, Membrane curvature.Figure 1.

It supports the calculation of vapor-liquid equilibria of pure fluids and multi-component mixtures described by rigid molecular models. For calculating phase equilibria, different methods are implemented in ms2, such as the grand equilibrium method. Furthermore, it is capable of sampling various classical ensembles and yields numerous thermodynamic properties such as the Helmholtz energy and its derivatives. To evaluate the chemical potential, Widom's test particle method and thermodynamic integration are implemented. Further entropic properties can be obtained using Krikwood-Buff integration method. Transport properties can be determined by equilibrium MD simulations following the Green-Kubo formalism. ms2 is written in Fortran90 and optimized for a fast execution on a broad range of computer architectures, spanning from single processor PCs over PC-clusters and vector computers to high-end parallel machines. The standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) is used for parallelization and ms2 is therefore easily portable onto a broad range of computing platforms.

A class of colloidal particles termed lobed colloids can be designed with protrusions (lobes) on their surfaces to provide directionality to interparticle interactions and enhanced excluded volume to facilitate porous self-assemblies. I will present results on self-assembly of several systems of lobed colloidal particles in which different characteristics of these particles, including their shapes, the sizes of their lobes, and the nature of their interparticle interactions, are varied. The systems were studied in either monodisperse (where all particles have the same shape) or polydisperse conditions (binary mixtures of particles with different shapes). The results reveal that the morphology and porosity of the self-assembled structures can be tuned by optimally designing the shapes and interparticle interactions among lobes. The relative size of the central seed particle and the lobes attached to it characterize the seed to lobe size ratio, which is found to be a key shape design parameter to achieve specific morphologies. Moreover, the polydisperse systems formed structures characterized by higher porosities in comparison to the monodisperse systems, which indicates that the composition of the system is also an important design feature for optimal self-assembly into desired morphologies.",

Topredict hydrophobicity, we need to understand the surface configuration of proteins. In thispresentation, we develop a patch based characterization of protein surfaces throughrepresentation learning. First, we break down proteins from the PDB database into surfacepatches. Then we construct and train a variational autoencoder to represent patches in a vectorform. Understanding similarities and differences in surface patches begins to suggestrelationships between molecular features and protein function. This is a crucial step towardprotein hydrophobicity mapping because it reduces the latent space of all possible proteinsdown to common surface patches. Mapping the constructed surface patch space allows us tomore easily predict protein function as well as similarities between proteins or different regionsof the same protein.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInverse design is a concept in which a desired set of properties is defined first, and then a material or molecule with those specific properties is designed through a systematic process. For the past 30 years, researchers have been actively studying Computer-Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) technology in the fields of bio-chemical materials and new drug development. Recently, with the application of big data and artificial intelligence technologies, the effectiveness of this technology has been realized. The primary goal of molecular design is to create new materials with improved physical properties compared to existing ones. To achieve this, an optimization process is used to propose a set of molecular structures for new materials or groups of similar materials that are expected to exhibit excellent physical properties. This process significantly reduces the number of materials that need to be synthesized or the range of physical properties that need to be measured through experiments. To maximize the efficiency of the optimization process based on supercomputing, algorithms that allow parallel searching are applied. Molecular dynamics and density functional theory are widely used to predict various properties of a substance based on its molecular structure through calculations, provided that the molecular structure is known through computation. To perform such calculations, a combination of databases and theoretical formulas are utilized. This study covers the basic composition for developing such software, as well as an example of a simple molecular design to test and develop the prototype program through a case study on the design of CO2 absorbent materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe semiconductor industry has experienced significant growth and change in recent years due to the increasing demand for smaller and more powerful devices. To meet this demand, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process has been introduced to create thinner and more precise layers. ALD processes offer high controllability, precise thickness control, and uniform thin film formation over a large area. To better understand and enhance these processes, computational modeling and simulation methodologies are being employed. This study focuses on the simulation of the diffusion and deposition process on the wafer surface using a Stochastic Parallel PARticle Kinetic Simulator (SPPARKS) and the kinetic Monte Carlo technique. Specifically, this study examines the chemical reactions of the chemical species present on the surface and sequentially pulsing and purging the surface with Dichlorosilane and ammonia gas. Adsorption, desorption, and deterioration occur probabilistically, which confirms the expected growth of the atomic layer. The growth of the atomic layer is compared with existing literature. The ultimate objective of this study is to develop a simulation model for a specific chemical species and predict the quality and thickness of the entire wafer under varying conditions, such as different pressures and temperatures. By providing insights into the ALD process and improving the ability to predict the properties of thin films, this study could play a crucial role in the development of smaller and more powerful devices in the semiconductor industry. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the power of computational modeling and simulation in advancing the ALD process. The results provide a foundation for developing a comprehensive simulation model to predict the quality and thickness of thin films on wafers under different conditions. These insights could ultimately enable the development of more precise, reliable, and efficient thin film deposition techniques, leading to the production of smaller and more powerful devices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractProtein-polymer bioconjugates are a class of hybrid biological molecules that strategically utilize the natural specificity of proteins and the synthetic modularity of polymers. Recently, the design and assembly of protein-polymer bioconjugates have gained much attention due to the potential applications of these bioconjugates in drug therapeutics, biomineralization, and biosensing. The conjugation of polymers to protein surfaces can enhance key properties of the biomolecule such as its structural stability and affinity for specific targets, while maintaining its natural biological functions. To optimally design and synthesize these hybrid molecules, the underlying mechanisms that influence their enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic properties must be understood at the molecular level. Computational approaches such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide an excellent entry point for such studies, via the development of accurate and compatible molecular models for studying broad variations of the protein-polymer bioconjugate system.Herein, we showcase the development of a computational framework for systematically building and testing models of protein-polymer bioconjugates that can be readily scaled for high-throughput processing. This methodological workflow encompasses variousin silicotools such as Python, C++, CGENFF, Gaussian, Avogadro, ChemDraw, VMD, and GROMACS. Specifically, we built and tested this framework on bovine alpha-chymotrypsin and hen egg-white lysozyme conjugated with sulfobetaine methacrylamide through atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiators, as well as on human interleukin 12 (IL-12) conjugated with activated polyethylene glycol (PEG). The framework itself, when combined with fundamental analysis methods such as MD, will support the rational design of novel bioconjugates with improved efficacy in terms of function and stability. To this end, we conducted MD simulations of the above bioconjugates in different chemical and biological environments, namely: (1) ATRP-initiated bioconjugates interacting with silica at various temperatures, and (2) PEG-ylated bioconjugates interacting with phospholipid membranes. In the former case, we sought to elucidate structural changes in the bioconjugates that could affect their adsorption to nanoparticle surfaces in drug delivery schemes. In the latter case, we sought to identify adsorption free energy differences between the bioconjugates and their non-conjugated counterparts to inform the use of these bioconjugates in protein therapeutics applications. Finally, through the development of this computational framework, we gained new atomistic insights into advanced protein functions and an improved understanding of the molecular driving forces governing bioconjugate stability.",

A major challenge is to rapidly identify the most promising MOF materials for various application. In this work, we used genetic algorithms (GA) and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to efficiently search for high-performing MOFs for CO2capture. We determined and analyzed the effects of important GA parameters, including the mutation probability, the number of MOFs per generation and the number of GA generations on the GA performance. We performed GA on-the-fly to optimize MOFs using multiple objective functions across different topologies. GA was able to determine top-performing MOFs that expanded beyond the previously known pareto fronts and reduced the cost of molecular simulations by a factor of 25.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAmyloid-beta (Aβ) is derived from the neuronal transmembrane protein Amyloid Precursor Protein, following its cleavage by a series of secretases. Self-aggregation of the resulting Aβpeptides into oligomers and plaques has been strongly implicated in mediating neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s disease1. However, recent studies have elucidated manybeneficialfunctions of Aβ, including its ability to repair holes in the blood-brain barrier, regulate synaptic properties of neurons, adopt antimicrobial peptide-like behaviors, and even exhibit antiviral behaviors towards foreign pathogens in the brain. In the latter case, for example, Aβhas been shown to sequester and remove herpes simplex virus (HSV-1)—which affects 67% of the human population—from the brain, via direct interactions with the virus’ surface glycoproteins2. Yet, the full picture of how Aβmediates these antiviral behaviors with respect to HSV-1, and other viral pathogens in the brain, remains unclear.The structure of Aβhas been observed to vary between a mostly unstructured coil in solution, to a helical form after coming into contact with a cellular membrane, to a neurotoxic beta sheet-like structure after the process of self-aggregation has begun. Moreover, Aβcommonly exists as both a 40- and 42-residue peptide, the latter of which is considered to be the more neurotoxic form3, but also the form with the more potent antiviral capabilities. As such, we hypothesized that the 42-residue Aβpeptide that resides in an unstructured or helical form would exhibit the strongest antiviral behavior, binding to HSV-1 glycoproteins in a way that directly interferes with their ability to bind to host cell receptors. To test this idea, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in triplicate using the GROMACS engine, of Aβin the six configurations (40- and 42-residue peptide in a coil, helical, or beta-sheet form), interacting with all four HSV-1 glycoproteins. Our results confirm that specific forms of Aβbind more strongly to HSV-1 glycoproteins than other forms, and that the most strongly-binding forms of Aβinteract with regions of HSV-1 glycoproteins that are crucial for host cell receptor binding. Overall, insights gained from these simulations may be used to guide the future design of novel drugs to prevent and/or treat HSV-1 infection in the brain. More broadly, this work provides a deeper understanding of the innate therapeutic properties of Aβin the brain and may help to elucidate the true role of Aβin other contexts like Alzheimer’s disease.References:[1] Chenet. al, Amyloid beta: structure, biology and structure-based therapeutic development.APS, 38(9):1205-1235.

    "abstract": "AbstractMonte Carlo simulations are carried out to provide molecular-level insights into the retention mechanism in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The stationary phases investigated here include a 9-nm cristobalite silica slit pore and a 9-nm amorphous silica slit pore. The mobile phases are water/acetonitrile mixtures at three compositions (neat acetonitrile, 5 and 10% v/v water in acetonitrile). The analytes include C1-C6 linear alkanes and alcohols. The simulations are performed at two temperatures, 303 and 333 K, and a pressure of 10 MPa. The simulations indicate that the stationary phase is retentive to the hydroxyl group (separating a primary alcohol from the linear alkane with the same number of carbon atoms) since the linear alcohols can form hydrogen bonds with the surface silanols and water molecules adsorbed on the silica surface. The addition of water reduces the retention increment of the OH group because of the stronger solvophilic effect. However, the contribution from the stationary phase to the retention of the OH group does not increase significantly as the water composition increases. Analyses of simulation trajectories provide insights into the structure of the HILIC phases, the orientational distribution of the solvent and analyte molecules, and the propensities of the silanol-analyte, silanol-water, and water-analyte hydrogen bond formation.",

Endoet al., proposed a method called MD-GAN [1,2], which predicts time evolution of the (sub)system in an equilibrium state. We applied the method to predict the diffusivity of Li ions in solid state electrolyte. Set of trajectory data of the Li ions were obtained using ab-initio MD with SIESTA code [3]. The set of data were used as input data for MD-GAN, and predictive model was trained to predict long time behavior of the ions.

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogels have attracted significant interest in a range of applications due to their complex physical and chemical structures, which enable multiscale interactions. Polyacrylamide hydrogels, in particular, offer a wide range of mechanical properties and exhibit biocompatibility and versatile customization. However, simulating the macroscale properties of hydrogels is challenging due to the intricate multiscale interactions that occur within them.To optimize the effect of each scale while considering the trade-off relationship among them for numerical methods, it is crucial to understand how multiscale structures influence the mechanical properties of hydrogels. In this study, we present a coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach for predicting the elastic modulus of hydrogels based on effective chain lengths of defect-less network structures. We utilized a mixed force-field that accounted for both bonded and non-bonded interactions, with the bonded potentials being extracted from atomistic simulation results and the MARTINI coarse-grained force field used to simulate the non-bonded parts of the hydrogel.Our model utilized coarse-grained potentials to depict the initial deformation of uniaxial tensile, indicating Young’s modulus, while also reflecting the effects of strain rates and swelling ratio on the modulus. Especially, strain rates should be treated with a caution due to rate differences of about 10 to the power of 6 to 10 per second, which could even be related to bond relaxation level inducing an exponential increase in modulus. Plus, the model was constructed with isotropic structures referencing experimental pre-gel conditions, being able to follow elastic properties’ propensity depending on cross linker density.Our findings demonstrate the potential of using coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to model and predict the elastic properties of hydrogels, despite the inherent randomness in their physical and chemical structures. Moreover, this approach could serve as a foundation for the development of various applications through versatile additives.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDevelopment of new materials capable of conducting protons in the absence of water is crucial for improving the performance, reducing the cost, and extending the operating conditions for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. We present an atomistic simulation-based workflow to computationally design fuel cell membrane materials using deep learning potentials (DPs) and graph lattice models (GLMs). Our workflow was used to demonstrate that graphanol (hydroxylated graphane) conducts protons anhydrously with very low diffusion barriers. First, DPs were trained for graphanol that have near-density functional theory accuracy but require a very small fraction of the computational cost. We used these DPs to calculate proton self-diffusion coefficients as a function of temperature, to estimate the overall barrier of proton diffusion, and to characterize the impact of thermal fluctuations as a function of system size. The sensitivity of intrinsic energy barriers to the overall diffusion barrier for proton conduction was further assessed using large-scale GLMs. We discovered, using this workflow, the existence of transient hydrogen-bonded structures, which we indicate asGrotthuss chains, that determine the mechanism of proton conduction in graphanol. We showed that protons can rapidly hop along Grotthuss chains containing several hydroxyl groups aligned such that hydrogen bonds allow for conduction of protons forward and backward along the chain without hydroxyl group rotation. Long-range proton transport only takes place as new Grotthuss chains are formed by rotation of one or more hydroxyl groups in the chain. Thus, the overall diffusion barrier consists of a convolution of the intrinsic proton hopping barrier and the intrinsic hydroxyl rotation barrier. The results obtained from the application of our workflow also enable us to propose specific design rules for developing next-generation proton conducting materials with diffusion barriers lower than existing systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractProtein-protein interactions play a crucial role in the stability and function of proteins. In therapeutic applications, protein associations like the dimerization and hexamerization of insulin play an essential role during transport and storage. To provide insights into insulin's physiological role and to develop more effective strategies for optimizing its stability and efficacy, it is vital to delve deeper into the formation of higher-order structures and the associated dissociation processes. While experimental and computational approaches such as molecular dynamics simulations have been used to understand the aggregation process, atomistic-level details of insulin hexamerization remain elusive. However, it is challenging to study higher-order protein aggregation using classical MD simulations alone, due to the timescales involved. Enhanced sampling methods such as metadynamics are powerful techniques to overcome slow fluctuations in the system and effectively explore the underlying free energy landscape.In this study, we investigate the process of insulin hexamerization by studying dimerization, followed by the association of three dimer pairs to form a hexamer. To effectively probe this process, we construct a new rotational collective variable (CV), which considers protein orientation and rotation relative to one another, offering detailed insights into the underlying association mechanisms. By employing well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD) and parallel bias metadynamics (PB-MetaD), we probe the thermodynamics of insulin dimer and hexamer formation to understand association and dissociation processes.

The method proposed by Behler and Parrinello uses atom-centered symmetric functions (ACSF) to encode both geometric and chemical information, predicting atomic energy with high-dimensional neural networks. While this approach is powerful for fitting interatomic potentials to ab-initio calculations, limited extrapolation capability remains a significant challenge since the computational cost of data acquisition is notoriously high.To address this issue, we introduce a regularization layer based on the analytical bond-order potential (BOP) model, imposing physical inductive bias to the model. Pairwise bond-order parameters are represented as functions of the local atomic environment using neural networks and are utilized in energy prediction with BOP. Our model demonstrates remarkable extrapolation capabilities for potential energy across unseen molecular geometries, which is unprecedented in conventional Behler-Parrinello neural network models.Moreover, our model offers a physically meaningful interpretation of the learned potential energy by decomposing it into pairwise interactions. We validate the energy decomposition by comparing it with the quantum-chemically derived intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI), which shows excellent agreement. We demonstrate the pairwise interaction analysis to the path of the SN2 reaction of methyl halides. It accurately captures the evolution of interatomic interactions throughout the reaction, showing the applicability of model on the study of chemically reactive systems.",

Although high ionic conductivity is one of the most significant factors for electrolytes, it is still remaining a challenge for SSE. Intuitively, cation and anion doping are regarded as the most efficient way to boost Li-ion diffusion. Another way is to analyze the dynamics of cations and anions through the properties of the structure itself, such as anion rotation in plastic crystals. Here, we explore the mechanism of the anion rotation-assisted Li ion diffusion in various anion frameworks in solid-state electrolytes. The Sulfide framework shows the dynamic motion than the halide one, thereby incrementing the Li-ion diffusion. Also, polyanion frameworks such as [PS4]3-, play a key role in Li-ion mobility. We also investigate the collective motion between the anion and the Li-ion and construct a way to maintain its motion even at room temperature.

    "abstract": "AbstractScientists have traditionally employed trial-and-error methodologies to design novel materials, often complemented by basic heuristic rules or chemical intuition (e.g., “like dissolves like”). However, to date, this simplistic approach has led to the discovery and characterization of only a small fraction of all synthesizable compounds. This limitation is aggravated when studying mixtures, particularly those that show potential in minimizing the environmental impact of the chemical industry, as the number of all possible molecule combinations is virtually infinite. The massive amount of resources and extreme cost necessary to explore this chemical landscape is simply too demanding to be feasible.Data-driven methods such as machine learning are promising alternatives to classical trial-and-error methodologies. The premise of these approaches consists of training machine learning models using existing datasets of known materials, and subsequently applying them to guide the development of new compounds by predicting physicochemical properties relevant to any given target application. However, a severe limitation of this approach lies on the representation of molecules in a machine-intelligible way (i.e., converting molecular structures to sets of numerical values that can be understood by mathematical machine learning models). In fact, most molecular representations proposed in the past lead to overly complex models that require a tremendous volume of experimental data to be properly trained.To bridge the gap between small, scarce datasets and data-driven approaches, this work aims at designing novel sustainable materials using thermodynamics-informed machine learning models, with a particular focus on green solvents. The use of thermodynamics information was achieved in two separate ways. The first was to use Gaussian processes (GPs) and active learning (AL) to describe activity coefficients (a single property), which can then be combined with thermodynamic models to predict a plethora of different solvent-related properties (e.g., phase equilibria). Relying on synthetic data generated from an excess Gibbs energy model, GPs were found to accurately describe the activity coefficients of several binary mixtures across large composition and temperature ranges. Moreover, GPs could estimate their own uncertainty and identify composition/temperature regions where activity coefficient data provides the most information to the models. This was leveraged to build AL algorithms targeted at modelling phase equilibria. In many cases, a single active-learning-acquired data point was sufficient to describe the phase diagrams studied. The ability of AL to greatly reduce the amount of data needed to obtain accurate models was further verified on experimental case studies, namely individual ion activity coefficients, the solid-liquid and vapor-liquid equilibrium of deep eutectic solvents, and phase equilibria in ternary mixtures.The second thermodynamics-informed approach was to develop a molecular descriptor that encodes thermodynamic information, namely molecular polarity, and that possesses a small, fixed size. In this sense, sigma profiles, a type of molecular descriptor obtained through quantum chemistry calculations, were used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that accurately correlate and predict a wide range of physicochemical properties (molar masses, normal boiling temperatures, vapor pressures, densities, refractive indexes, and aqueous solubilities). To boost their performance, the architecture and hyperparameters of each CNN were optimized using a battery of algorithms, particularly Bayesian Optimization and Local Search. Furthermore, it was shown that thermodynamic conditions, namely temperature, can also be used as additional inputs to broaden the applicability of the models.Finally, inverse design workflows based on this type of thermodynamics information (active learning on the sigma profile space) were also constructed, which enable the computational design of tailor-made materials bounded by a set of physicochemical properties selected based on a given application of interest. The results of this work constitute a major breakthrough in the way novel materials can be designed, as the machine learning models developed are robust, accurate, and generic enough to be applied across several families of compounds and materials.",

However, the molecular structure of ILs in bulk and dilute solutions remain poorly understood and prevents the rational design of ILs [4-6]. Molecular simulations can address this problem by modeling the formation of IL nanostructures that is difficult to observe via experiments. Using both the concentration of IL-solvent mixtures knobs, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to quantify concentration-dependent changes in ILstructure. From MD trajectories, we determined how interactions between the IL and solvent impact structure through graph-theoretic representations of IL nanostructure. We show that EMIM-BF4exhibits variations in the tendency to form both charged and neutral molecular-scale clusters as a function of concentration ranging from the dilute to neat regimes. Via these graph-theoretic methods, we investigated quantitative parameters of IL structure (such as length of nonpolar alkyl group) that influence IL structural clustering such as: size of clusters, number of clusters, and number of neutral clusters. These quantitative metrics will permit understanding of how IL structure impacts electrolyte properties which is necessary for fine-tuning electrochemical systems.[1] K. Shimizu, C. E. S.

    "abstract": "AbstractDensity functional theory suffers from self-interaction errors that generally result in the underestimation of chemical reaction barrier heights. This is commonly attributed to the tendency of density functional approximations to overstabilize delocalized densities that typically occur in the stretched bonds of transition state structures. The Perdew–Zunger self-interaction correction (PZSIC) and locally scaled self-interaction correction (LSIC) improve the prediction of barrier heights of chemical reactions, with LSIC giving better accuracy than PZSIC on average. These methods employ an orbital-by-orbital correction scheme to remove the one-electron SIE.In the context of barrier heights, this allows an analysis of how the self-interaction correction (SIC) for each orbital contributes to the calculated barriers using Fermi–Löwdin orbitals. We hypothesize that the SIC contribution to the reaction barrier comes mainly from a limited number of orbitals that are directly involved in bond-breaking and bond-making in the reaction transition state. We call these participant orbitals (POs), in contrast to spectator orbitals (SOs) which are not directly involved in changes to the bonding.We test this hypothesis for the reaction barriers of the BH76 benchmark set of reactions. We find that the stretched-bond orbitals indeed make the largest individual SIC contributions to the barriers. These contributions increase the barrier heights relative to LSDA, which underpredicts the barrier. However, the full stretched-bond hypothesis does not hold in all cases for either PZSIC or LSIC. There are many cases where the total SIC contribution from the SOs is significant and cannot be ignored. The size of the SIC contribution to the barrier height is a key indicator. A large SIC correction is correlated to a large LSDA error in the barrier, showing that PZSIC properly gives larger corrections when corrections are needed most. A comparison of the performance of PZSIC and LSIC shows that the two methods have similar accuracy for reactions with large LSDA errors, but LSIC is clearly better for reactions with small errors. We trace this to an improved description of reaction energies in LSIC.",
