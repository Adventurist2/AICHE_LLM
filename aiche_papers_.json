    "abstract": "AbstractIn recent years, machine learning (ML) methodshave transformed computational chemistry and materials research. At the start of any machine learning inquiry we must first ask: how do we represent our system? This question is at the core of many ML methods, ranging from end-to-end methods, that take \"raw\" data formats and use multi-layer architectures to implicitly encode the chemical information to \"feature-forward\" methods, that use physics and chemistry to design numerical representations conducive to machine learning workflows. While both approaches have merits and overlaps, the latter often allows for added tunability to identify the role of key parameters in the design space and more straightforward interpretation.There are many ways to encode the raw chemical data into features, and the suitable choice largely depends on the problem at hand. For cheminformatics, string-based featurizations such as SMILES or SELFIES are popular, as they encode important parameters such as present functional groups and connectivity and can be parsed using NLP models and other text-based advancements. However, in thermodynamic contexts, where the chemistry and connectivity remains largely unchanged, such as in molecular simulation, it is more typical to use configuration-dependent features, which transform molecular coordinates into a range of suitable numerical representations.Yet, that leaves many of us that work beyond the atomic scale without many options for thermodynamic representations that reflect the complex interactions of mesoscale building blocks. Of the frameworks developed for atomic representations, density-based frameworks present the most compelling avenue for expansion. Furthermore, by defining our representations within the same conceptual framework as our atomic counterparts, we beget an ability to combine or compare representations across multiple scales, which is desperately needed for multiscale simulation and understanding and designing cross-scale phenomena.Here, we introduce and demonstrate a first-such expansion of density-based frameworks for ML representations by taking the popular SOAP (Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions) formalism and demonstrating its expansion to simple anisotropic bodies. We provide both the mathematical theory behind this expansion and demonstrate several case-studies for its usage across multiple simulation length-scales and materials systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractParticle-based simulations like molecular dynamics are ubiquitous throughout academia and industry, yet these methods suffer from several well-known limitations. One limitation is that particle-based simulations struggle to reach equilibrium when a system contains a broad spectrum of timescales, such as in polymeric materials, which often necessitates excessively long simulation times. Another limitation is that the free energy is not directly accessible in a particle-based simulation and must be computed using enhanced sampling methods. In this talk, I describe a new method that address both of these limitations. The basis for our approach is a new type of ``multi-representation'' simulation where particle and field-theoretic simulations are linked together into a unified framework. Our approach involves the construction of formally equivalent particle and field-theoretic models that are simulated subject to the constraint that their spatial density profiles are equal. This constraint provides the ability to rapidly map between particle and field-theoretic representations so that simulations can be performed in the particle/field representation where calculations are most efficient. Our approach can leverage the superior numerical properties of field-theoretic simulations to rapidly relax the largest length scales within a system and to calculate the free energy, yet can backmap into a particle-based representation when molecular configurations and dynamics are desired. Furthermore, by leveraging the formal equivalence between particle and field-based simulations, these calculations can be placed on a rigorous theoretical foundation that can be constructed without approximation. Our method is illustrated using both linear diblock copolymers and intrinsically-disordered proteins. In both cases, our method can provide direct access to the free energy, rapid equilibration, molecular configurations and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInspired by naturally occurring hierarchical materials, numerous beautiful and functional mesoscale architectures have been constructed in labs using solid-state nanoscale building blocks and bio- or biomimetic molecules via self-assembly. Their structures and assembly dynamics are tightly regulated by the system's convoluted energetics and entropic information, which may even respond to a minuscule change. For example, we recently reported a pH-regulated self-assembly of silica nanoparticles facilitated by an engineered bifunctional silica-binding protein sfGFP::Car9-Car9. The assembly and disassembly can be reversibly and cyclically modulated by alternating the solution pH between 7.5 and 8.5. In another study, we observed that an increment of the peptoid (i.e., the ligand) length by two monomers at a time would change the arrangement of a CdS quantum dot superlattice from close packing to square, further to monoclinic. However, the complexity of the nanoscale colloidal system often makes it difficult to probe the underlying physics via experimental means. Alternatively, we can construct suitable multi-scale theoretical toolkits by carefully selecting and combining theories and simulation algorithms from different levels (i.e., from ab initio to coarse-grained models) to connect the scales and gain physical insights into the assembly mechanisms. In this talk, I will elaborate on how we used multi-scale theoretical frameworks to reveal the key driving forces of self-assembly in these two cases. The knowledge we gained on the distinctive roles of organic ligands has further inspired new design principles in future studies",

Mitigation strategies are discussed for detecting the breakdown of continuum modeling at micro scales wherein Knudsen effects and other anomalous behaviors emerge. Characterization of model factor inputs and the techniques for their sourcing is described with consideration to the construction of a high throughput multi-scale shape optimized computational schema. Four objectives guided the development of this model.

The second objective was to assemble, reduce, and analyze model constants and approximations that express FEM coefficient calculations as physical forces and thermodynamic properties which could be derived from other computational methods. Third, to analyze factor sensitivity of model inputs by way of a $2^k$ factorial screening to determine which inputs are driving the physics of water harvesting adsorption systems. The fourth objective was to design the FEM solver for integration into a multi-scale high throughput topologically optimized schema.

    "abstract": "AbstractAlthough monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are some of the most profitable and promising pharmaceuticals for targeted therapies, physical instabilities at high concentration including aggregation, high viscosity and phase separation cause problems for their manufacture, delivery to patients and long term stability. In this work, we present a multiscale methodology which uses all-atom modeling and experimental second osmotic virial coefficients to develop coarse-grained models for flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations of hundreds of mAbs with sub-nanometer resolution. In this multiscale modeling approach, the major assumption is that mAb domains are held fixed so that their atomistic interactions with implicit solvent can be precomputed and therefore increase simulation efficiency by a few orders of magnitude. Although domains within the mAbs are rigid, the coarse-grained model includes the flexibility of the hinge region, which is often neglected but here shown to play an important role at mAb concentrations up to 150 g/L. This approach is also amenable to modeling excipients, co-formulations and surface interactions. Simulations were validated against experimental measurements and used to predict the physical stability of mAbs. These results highlight the potential for this multiscale approach to pre-screen pharmaceutical candidate mAbs in early stage development to avoid high concentration physical instabilities that can plague later stage development.",

Despite their importance, membrane proteins (MPs) represent only 2% of all protein structures in the protein data bank (PDB), and their complexes are even scarcer. Computational methods are promising tools for modeling MP interfaces and predicting complex structures. Here, we present RosettaMPDock, a flexible transmembrane protein docking protocol that captures binding induced conformational changes.To generate diversity in backbone conformations for the RosettaMPDock, we used three conformer generation methods: perturbation of the backbones along the normal modes by 1 Å, refinement using the Relax protocol, backbone flexing using the Rosetta Backrub protocol.RosettaMPDock samples large conformational ensembles of flexible monomers and docks together protein targets within an implicit membrane environment.To improve the scoring efficiency, we have used a combination of low-resolution Motif Dock Score and membrane based high-resolution score Franklin2023.RosettaMPDock is benchmarked on 30 transmembrane-protein complexes of variable flexibility dataset. Our results show RosettaMPDock successfully predicts the correct interface (success defined as achieving 3 near-native structures in the 5 top-ranked ones) for 67% of moderately flexible targets (unbound-bound backbone motion within 1.5-2.5Å) and 60% of the highly flexible targets (unbound-bound backbone motion greater than 2.5Å), a substantial improvement from the existing membrane protein docking methods.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe barrier function of the human skin is primarily located in the stratum corneum (SC), which is composed of corneocytes surrounded by a dense, lamellar lipid matrix made up of ceramides (CERs), cholesterol (CHOL), and free fatty acids (FFAs) of various lengths. While experimentalists can reproduce the lipid organization of intact SC with model systems using synthetic lipids,1the role of each lipid in the formation of the molecular structure of the SC, and hence the barrier properties of skin, is not well understood due to the complex nature of the SC lipid matrix. To address this need, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of pre-assembled lipids in primarily bilayer configurations have been used to study the behavior of the SC lipids.2However, such simulations can suffer from configurational bias due to low lipid mobility, and further, simple bilayers cannot sufficiently represent the complexity of SC multilayer structures. Thus, in order to emulate the experimental model membrane formation at long timescales and large system sizes, we developed computationally efficient coarse-grained (CG) models using the Multi-State Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (MS-IBI) method.3Here, we begin our multiscale strategy of understanding SC lamella with the CG self-assembly of large complex multilayer mixtures of multiple CERs, CHOL, and FFAs that match previously examined experimental compositions. Specifically, we go beyond the commonly studied CER NS to simulate mixtures with CERs NS, NP, AS, and AP as well as understanding the role of FFA tail length distribution. Atomistic configurations generated by back-mapping theself-assembled multi-lamellar CG configurationsprovide insights into lipid organization and structure of experimental model membranes. This multiscale approach accumulates simulation and collaborative experiments providing a holistic picture of structural properties, hydrogen bonding capabilities, and neutron scattering studies to better understand the relationship between composition of SC lipids and the barrier function of skin.References(1) Bouwstra, J.

We used iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) to parameterize the conservative potential and reproduce the structural distributions of the melt from all-atom (AA) reference simulations, and Langevin dynamics to introduce a dissipative potential as a means to recover the AA dynamics. Using this method, we found we could repair the dynamics of various diffusive measures with about a 20% variation or less in the friction parameter. Here we further our analysis this CG model by examining the influence of Langevin friction on the dynamics of the individual potentials. Various dynamic correlation functions are used to quantify and compare the dynamics of the bonded and pair potentials for the diffusion corrected CG models and the AA reference systems. This leads to an integrated approach for recovering both structure and dynamics within the scope of an IBI based parametrization by properly accounting for separate enthalpic and entropic contributions to the potentials.

    "abstract": "AbstractPolymer synthesis has become increasingly sophisticated and current developments in precise sequence-controlled polymers allow for new design opportunities. However, the enormous number of possible sequences requires robust and efficient modeling to understand and predict how sequence impacts material properties. Here, we use sequence-specific polypeptoids (a biomimetic of polypeptides) as a platform for developing design rules for relating chemical sequence to polymer conformation. Polypeptoids are particularly useful in this context due to their lack of backbone hydrogen bonding, isolating the effect of sidechain chemical sequence on polymer chain shape. Moreover, they are routinely synthesized at gram scale, sequence-specifically, with hundreds of different side chain functionalities, allowing for detailed experimental investigation and validation. Our earlier simulation studies of small polypeptoid systems with advanced sampling molecular dynamics methods examined changes in the local and global structure of short chains in response to the number and location of the hydrophobic and chiral monomers, with excellent agreement with experiments. However, to study broader chain shape effects and self-assembly behaviors, access to longer and multiple peptoid systems requires coarse-grained simulations that can exceed the limitations of atomistic simulations.Here, we develop a bottom-up coarse-grained peptoid model using the relative entropy approach to create a library of peptoid monomers suitable for studying CG models of a wide range of sequences in both long chain and self-assembly simulations. We validate our CG models with experimental end-to-end distance measurements measured from double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy. We also leverage inverse design methods to suggest sequences with unique folding and self-assembly properties into various structures as a way to investigate fundamental limits of sequence design. These new computational methods provide molecular insight into the driving forces for polymer conformation and are exciting as new in silico screening tools to guide the development of sequence-specific polymeric materials with tunable properties.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe success of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapies relies on the innate immune response, which can be modulated by small molecules to inhibit unfavorable systemic inflammation for prophylactic vaccines and improve immune stimulation for immunotherapies to mitigate suppression from tumor micro-environment. Traditional screening methods for discovering small molecule with specific pharmaceutical usages are time-consuming and resource-intensive, and often fail to identify novel compounds with high efficacy. In addition, although human intuition and experience present valuable heuristics to guide this search, the relative infancy of immunomodulator discovery efforts, absence of mechanistic understanding, and vast size of molecular space can make these heuristics limiting and subject to human preconceptions, bias, and potential blind spots.We have developed a machine learning-enabled active learning pipeline to guide in vitro experimental screening and discovery of small molecule immunomodulators that alter the signaling activity of innate immune responses stimulated by traditional pattern recognition receptor agonists. Molecules were tested by in vitro high throughput screening (HTS) where we measured modulation over the activation of two major effector of human immunity, the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB) pathway and the interferon regulatory factors (IRF) pathway. These data were used to train data-driven predictive models linking molecular structure to their immunomodulatory activity using deep representational learning, Gaussian process regression (GPR), and Bayesian optimization (BO). The deep representational learning model was trained to convert molecular structure to continuous embeddings with 97% reversible fidelity. The GPR and BO converged after four rounds of discovery loop between computation and experimentation with stabilized prediction and minimized error.By interleaving successive rounds of model training and in vitro HTS, we performed an active learning-guided traversal of a 139,998-molecule library using a fraction of the time and material costs associated with exhaustive screening. After experimentally evaluating only around 2% of the library, we discovered molecules with unprecedented immunomodulatory capacity, including those capable of suppressing NF-κB activity by up to 15-fold, elevating NF-κB activity by up to 5-fold, and elevating IRF activity by up to 3-fold. A subset of our top-performing candidates, namely 17 compounds, was tested to validate their immunomodulatory effect by measuring cytokine release profiles. One of these molecules demonstrated a 40-fold enhancement in IFN-β production. In addition, we rationalized the correlation between the chemical structure and immunomodulatory capacity by using a linear regression model and interpretable molecular features and discovered design rules for immunomodulators.Our machine learning-enabled screening approach presents an efficient immunomodulator discovery pipeline that has furnished a library of novel small molecules with unprecedented capacity to enhance or suppress innate immune signaling pathways. This has the potential to improve prophylactic vaccination by minimizing side effects and addressing vaccination hesitancy, and to enhance the potency of immunotherapies. This collection of new small molecule immunomodulators may progress to subsequent screenings, in vivo studies, clinical trials, and eventually become a pharmaceutical product, if successful. Furthermore, this machine learning-based screening strategy can be employed in drug discovery and development, especially in pipelines lacking well-defined mechanistic insights and requiring expensive experimental assessments.",

For these complex, viscous mixtures, the titration process is carried out manually in a painstakingly slow trial-and-error process by experienced industrial scientists. Herein, we accelerate the pH adjustment process by i) building a new robotic platform capable of titrating these challenging viscous formulations, ii) developing further the active machine learning (ML)-driven pH adjustment strategy presented by Pomberger et al., 2023. The platform's novel design with a 3d-printed overhead stirrer and pH probe in a single position facilitates the titration of viscous samples. Additionally, a washing station involving a soak & jetting down in isopropyl alcohol enables full automation as the robot moves between the closed-loop pH adjustment of different samples. Consumer products are typically titrated with citric acid, as this weak, polyprotic acid can confer the final product a strong buffering effect to remain at the target pH, resulting in a longer shelf-life. However, the prior literature has only developed an ML strategy compatible with strong-strong acid/base titrant pairs. Here a weak-strong acid/base pair is considered, where the deprotonation state of the weak acid depends on the pH, and there is a possibility of forming a complex buffer solution if the target pH is overshot. Accordingly, a data-driven approach (Gaussian Process regression) is combined with physical chemistry to present a hybrid model capable of efficiently guiding the robotic platform to the target pH. Finally, scale-up studies are underway, with the aim that this technology is adopted into industrial high-throughput formulations workflows.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAutomation in many of the experimental pipelines both at laboratory and central facilities has shifted the bottleneck to autonomously-driven data analysis and decision-making. Exponential growth in tools available for data-driven modeling resulted in the advent of self-driven laboratories (SDL) that aims to automate and accelerate the entire workflow starting from synthesis to characterization and device integration for emerging technologies and energy needs. Platforms based on solution-processible materials (polymers, colloids, and nanoparticles) are amenable to automation both at the synthesis and characterization levels. Techniques such as scattering and spectroscopy provide faster high-throughput alternatives to capture a signal of the underlying structure allowing us to construct composition-structure phase maps. Although obtaining a structure phase map from high throughput structural characterization data is a decade-old problem, many of the state-of-the-art approaches are not generalizable beyond their initial application in X-ray diffraction. In particular, small-angle scattering (SAS) used to probe the structure of nanoscale material results in a continuous signal where the key information is not just in peak positions but also the overall ‘shape’ of the curve. Thus, self-driven laboratories for soft materials should be equipped with tools that can process the shape of SAS curves into useful information for decision-making and optimization. In this talk, we present a novel approach that uses Riemannian metric geometry to develop a shape-based measure for analyzing SAS curves. We use this novel analysis tool in an SDL to build a phase map of the block copolymer system in an iterative closed-loop fashion. Our approach allows the decision-making to be built on top of multiple Riemannian metric fields each corresponding to an order parameter of the phase map. Using a case study of a novel polymer blend, we show that the learned order parameters are continuous and thus have an interpretation in terms of multi-phase transitions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMolecular discovery is a constrained multi-objective optimization problem that aims to identify one or more molecules that balance multiple, often competing, properties. One approach to molecular design is to evaluate the properties of all molecules in a virtual library (“virtual screening”), and methods based on active learning and Bayesian optimization have previously been proposed to accelerate virtual screening [1, 2]. However, these methods typically consider single-objective optimization only or, in the case of multi-objective optimization, combine properties of interest into a scalarized objective [3]. A promising alternative to scalarization is Pareto optimization, which can elucidate the trade-offs between objectives and does not rely on assumptions about the relative importance of objectives. In the context of molecular discovery, Pareto optimization identifies the molecules that optimally balance multiple desired properties, revealing the best that is possible in the objective space.We combine Pareto optimization and Bayesian optimization methods to efficiently search a library of millions of molecules and identify those that optimally balance multiple objectives. Using graph neural networks as the surrogate model architecture, we apply this methodology to identify (1) dual inhibitors which minimize docking scores to two targets and (2) selective small molecule inhibitors which minimize docking scores to an on-target and maximize those to an off-target. We compare optimization performance between Pareto and scalarization acquisition functions and find that multi-objective acquisition functions outperform scalarization. This improvement is greater for the selective inhibitor task due to stronger competition between the objectives. Finally, we find that encouraging molecular and functional diversity during acquisition does not improve the hypervolume of acquired molecules but does increase the diversity of the acquired set.[1] Gentile, F.; Agrawal, V.; Hsing, M.; Ton, A.-T.; Ban, F.; Norinder, U.; Gleave, M.

    "abstract": "AbstractAcquiring accurate 3D geometries of reactive chemical species and transition states (TS) along reaction pathways over the potential energy surface is a critical prerequisite for computing high-quality thermodynamic and kinetic parameters via quantum chemistry and statistical mechanics. These calculated thermo-kinetic parameters are essential for creating impactful predictive models that can assist pharmaceutical design, high-performance material development, and renewable energy research. However, the search for transition states has historically been a trial-and-error process that demands considerable manual input. Although automated TS search has a rich history of algorithmic development, existing methods like single-ended and double-ended approaches are often computationally demanding, have high failure rates, and are highly localized to specific reaction systems, making it challenging to learn from previous examples and enhance performance. Therefore, efficiently automating the TS search is essential for enabling high-throughput chemical reactivity discovery and streamlining the generation of extensive theoretical reaction datasets that are valuable for developing machine-learning-based chemistry surrogate models. In this presentation, we introduce QuantumPioneer, a self-evolving machine capable of automatically generating validated 3D electronic structures for a given reaction using atom-mapped SMILES as input. QuantumPioneer can enhance its performance over time by learning from past experiences and can be seamlessly integrated into an active learning loop for closed-loop chemical discovery. Moreover, QuantumPioneer can be tailored to specific chemical-exploration tasks and generate extensive theoretical reaction datasets that lay the foundation for future studies with wide-ranging applications. To showcase its capabilities, we employed QuantumPioneer to generate TS at ωB97XD/def2svp level of theory for over 100,000 hydrogen atom abstraction (HAbs) reactions between peroxyl radicals and a diverse set of organic molecules chosen based on their functional groups. This dataset represents one of the largest DFT TS collections for radical-based reactions to date, laying the foundation for future studies with wide-ranging applications. We further refined the dataset with COSMO-RS and DLPNO-CCSD(T1)-F12D single-point calculations and trained D-MPNN models to predict HAbs reaction barriers. We will demonstrate how the machine learning model for HAbs barrier height prediction can potentially be applied to conduct high-throughput virtual screening of oxidative stability of organic molecules and aid better design of high-value chemicals such as active pharmaceutical ingredients and carbon capture amines.",

    "abstract": "AbstractClostridioides difficileinfection is the leading cause of diarrhea and colitis (inflammation of the colon) in North America and Europe. The fraction of the population infected by the disease is increasing as new strains associated with significant morbidity and mortality have appeared. There is a growing concern about the failure of the first line of treatment forC. diff.infection (metronidazole and vancomycin) and thus, current attention is focused on the need for alternative treatment options like biologic drugs which are safer and more efficacious. A viable and cost-effective strategy is to develop targeted peptide-based therapeutics that prevent and treatC. diff.infections by deactivating the pathogen while leaving the resident gut microbiota unharmed.During infection, theC. diff.pathogen produces two large virulent toxins (toxins A and B) that share 71% sequence homology. The glucosyltransferase domain (GTD) of these toxins acts by binding uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose, hydrolyzing it into glucose and UDP, and attaching the glucose monomer to the human Rho family of GTPases. Glycosylation of the GTPases by toxin A and toxin B GTDs leads to disruption of the cytoskeleton, apoptosis, and death of the colon epithelial cells.The objective of this project is to computationally design peptide inhibitors that bind with high affinity and specificity toC. diff.toxin A GTD and toxin B GTD to inhibit its activity. We use an automatedPeptideBindingDesign (PepBD) algorithm developed in our lab to design peptide sequences that bind toC. diff.Toxin A. Our peptide search algorithm employs Monte Carlo methods, self-consistent mean-field theory, and the concerted rotation (CONROT) technique to search for peptides in sequence and conformation space that bind to a target protein. The starting input structure for the algorithm requires a reference ligand, which is usually an experimentally determined peptide sequence that has a good binding affinity to the target protein.We identified an 8-mer peptide, SA1, that binds to theClostridioides difficiletoxin A GTD. The efficacy of peptide SA1 was tested using a trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay on monolayers of the human gut epithelial culture model. Peptide SA1 blocks TcdA toxicity in jejunum (small intestine) cells and in colon epithelial cells and exhibits a binding affinity in the nanomolar range. Next, we designed peptides that bind to toxin B GTD. Preliminary experimental data suggest that two of ourin-silicoidentified peptides, SB2 and SB6, are inhibiting glycosylation of toxin B GTD with an IC50 in the micromolar range. Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential of our computational peptide design protocol to identify peptide-based inhibitors that can treatClostridoides difficileinfection and other infectious pathogens in the future.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe discovery of new materials with desired properties is important because it can lead to significant advancements in technology and applications. Moreover, the discovery of these new materials tends to have properties that are hard to coexist with or have a very high or low value of specific properties. For example, in the case of transparent electrodes, two properties, transparent and electric, are challenging to exist simultaneously. Here, the problem is that in contrast to conventional materials, few (or any) known samples exhibit these characteristics. Because of this, chemists find it challenging to gain insights or knowledge from the existing materials that might be used to derive the molecular structures of the desired materials.In recent years, machine learning has provided a new methodology for screening novel materials with high performance, developing quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) and other models, predicting the properties of materials, and finding new materials [1]. However, since most machine learning-based models are probability distribution-based models, such as conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) [2] and conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) [3], there is a limit to finding materials with extreme characteristic values, since there are very few corresponding molecular samples. In contrast, reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning which learns policy (or order of action) that maximizes reward among selectable actions. Unlike probability distribution-based models, reinforcement learning relies solely on the reward, so it does not matter if a few existing molecules satisfy the target property. Combinatorial chemistry is a methodology that can generate a large number of molecules by combining fragments according to chemical rules. An example of combinatorial chemistry is the Breaking of retrosynthetically interesting chemical substructures (BRICS) [4]. Applying the BRICS rule, molecules can be broken into fragments, or new molecular structures can be generated by combining those fragments.In this study, we present reinforcement learning to provide combinatorial chemistry a strategy for choosing molecular fragments that directs the molecule that is generated toward the target. With a randomly selected initial fragment, our model selects the next fragment to be combined, considering the chemical rule so that the model can only generate chemically valid molecules. The policy is learned by giving a higher reward if the target properties are satisfied. This learned policy efficiently searches large chemical spaces using combinatorial chemistry. We empirically showed that our model is suitable for discovering novel materials by conducting experiments on several cases, and compared the result with two probability distribution-learning models, conditional recurrent neural network (cRNN) [5] and generative chemical transformer (GCT) [6]. Moreover, after showing that our model performs well by implementing it to a simple problem, we discuss how to improve the performance of the reinforcement learning model and implement the model in real-world problems.[1] Liu, Y., et al.,Materials discovery and design using machine learning.Journal of Materiomics, 2017.3(3): p. 159-177.[2] Sohn, K., H.

    "abstract": "AbstractRare earth elements (REE), or lanthanides, are critical materials with a wide range of applications in clean energy industrysuch as battery, semiconductor, and electric vehicles, due to their unique luminescent, magnetic, and catalytic properties. Therefore, there is a growing demand for developing green industrial-scale extraction of lanthanides. However, efficient separation of heavy lanthanides (e.g. from Europium to Lutetium) with exceedingly similar chemical properties is technologically challenging, and is an active area of research. Here, we combine molecular dynamics (MD), enhanced sampling, and machine learning methods to design insilico short 17-residue peptides that selectively bind to trivalent REE cations in aqueous solution. The REE-peptide binding affinity are predicted by ML models that are trained on features that characterize the REE-peptide binding complex including hydration properties of REEs from literature studies, REE-peptide interaction energies obtained from MD simulations, and physicochemical properties of the peptide estimated from the DBAASP peptide database. Starting from the original lanthanide-binding tag (LBT) peptide, we computationally screen peptide candidates with mutations mainly on the six key ligating residues that improve predicted binding selectivity against 12 different REEs. Candidates with top selectivity scores selected from in silico discovery are verified by the fluorescence titration experiments. Moreover, we utilize a novel genetic algorithm framework to iteratively guide the design of new peptide sequences combining our model and experiments. Therefore, we demonstrate an integrated data-driven approach for quantitative sequence-structure-activity relationship as well as design of lanthanide binding peptides, paving the road for designing novel biomolecules for efficient rare earth elements recovery.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe discovery of functional materials has traditionally been driven by chemists’ intuition and manual experimentation; the automation of the design-make-test-analyze (DMTA) cycle presents a promising alternative for accelerating multi-functional materials discovery.Integrating advancements in automatization and machine learning (ML), we developed a closed-loop, autonomous molecular discovery platform to both accelerate hit-to-lead (exploration) and lead-optimization (exploitation) workflows for molecules with multiple desired properties. The platform was designed for general chemistry with general, adaptable synthesis, workup, isolation, and characterization protocols. These capabilities can accommodate the diversity of molecules and multi-step syntheses recommended by its molecular generation and retrosynthesis algorithms. We demonstrate this platform in exploration and exploitation case studies without human intervention (beyond providing consumables and error recovery) on dye-like molecules targeting wavelength of maximum absorption, water–octanol partitioning, and photo-oxidative stability.In the exploration study, the platform, guided by property-prediction ML models, automatically performed three iterations of the DMTA cycle. Using inexpensive syntheses to diverse targets as its means to explore and learn the structure–function space of four rarely reported scaffolds, the platform realized 312 unreported molecules and substantially improved the predictions of the guiding property-prediction models in these local chemical spaces. In the exploitation study, the same platform leveraged models trained on pre-existing examples of a fifth scaffold to discover 6 top-performing molecules within their structure–property space.The platform demonstrates the potential for automated platforms which integrate the steps of the molecular discovery cycle (prediction, synthesis, measurement, and model retraining) to autonomously understand a local chemical space to aid in the discovery of functional molecules. As the components of this automated DMTA cycle are modular, with alternate property or retrosynthesis models, additional functionalities could be explored, such as biological activity, requiring only the deployment of the corresponding characterization hardware and/or protocols.This platform is the culmination of many collaborators across multiple laboratories, and as such, this presentation will focus on the design of the experimental platform and its integration with its governing models to achieve autonomous operation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPurpose:Liposomes are vesicles composed of a lipid bilayer and/or a concentric series of multiple bilayers commonly used as carriers for drug delivery purposes. In contrast to the conventional pathway of cell uptake, previous studies have proposed that fusogenic liposomes have the advantages of fusing with the cell membrane and directly releasing the cargo to the cytosol. However, there is a lack of deep understanding of the structural impact of the individual lipid on its assemblies, and uncovering the driving force that differentiates the route of the cellular uptake has been challenging. Here, we implemented coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations to predict the physicochemical properties of new lipids, simulate their propensity to self-assemble into liposomes, and determine the correlation between liposome size and lipid structural properties.Methods:The CG-MD simulations were implemented using the GROMACS software package with the MARTINI 3.0 force fields, and the trajectory analyses were conducted using MDAnalysis and PackMem. The all-atom model of examined new lipids, which composed of an amino acid-based head group, a spacer group, and two alkyl tail groups of various lengths, was first constructed using the webserver LigParGen. The new lipid model was then mapped and parameterized into the coarse-grained model. The constructed new CG lipid model was energy-minimized with the steepest descent algorithm, followed by a 10 ns equilibration in an isothermal−isochoric ensemble at ambient temperature. The cubic simulation system of various sizes (10 nm3, 25 nm3, 50 nm3, and 100 nm3) was built as mixture of water and randomly distributed lipids. The 200-ns simulation production runs were performed in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble using the Nosé−Hoover thermostat and the Parrinello−Rahman barostat at a pressure of 1 bar. The simulations were carried out using periodic boundary conditions in a 20-fs time step and the final trajectory was extracted for further physicochemical property analysis. All computations were performed using the High-Performance Computing (HPC) Supercomputer Cluster at Genentech.Results:The CG-MD simulations indicate that the examined lipids self-assemble into liposomes and micelles of various shapes and sizes within 100ns into the production run. Analysis of the radius of gyration showed that all liposomes formed were initially unstable and experienced significant fluctuations in their morphology. During this early stage, the liposomes usually transitioned from an elongated shape to an elliptical shape, eventually stabilizing into a mostly spherical shape that persisted for the duration of the simulation. Furthermore, the simulations showed that the thickness of fusogenic liposome bilayer was influenced by only certain types of amino acid head group, while the length of the spacer and the alkyl tail groups influence the liposome bilayer thickness independently from the head group. The curvature analysis provided detailed insights into the behavior of the membrane bilayer, revealing that the inner monolayer was more curved than the outer monolayer. The evaluation of three-dimensional packing defects in the membrane bilayer showed that liposome formation in this study was characterized by more deep defects than shallow defects, which indicates the regions where the hydrophobic lipid tails are transiently exposed to the aqueous polar environment leading to unstable liposomal structure. The simulation findings will be further validated through experimental studies using the same fusogenic lipids.Conclusions:While the simulation exercises did not accurately replicate the experimental particle size, potentially due to computational limitations, they still effectively uncovered the mechanism behind the formation of liposomes and their structural properties using newly designed fusogenic lipids with varying head groups, spacer lengths, and tail lengths. The MD computational platform developed in this study has proven to be a powerful tool that can help to facilitate the synthesis and testing of fusogenic lipids with specific desired properties. Not only this, but it is also capable of guiding the interpretation, explanation, and direction of experimental studies in this area.Keywords:Fusogenic liposomes, Molecular dynamics simulations, Coarse-grained, Membrane defects, Membrane curvature.Figure 1.

It supports the calculation of vapor-liquid equilibria of pure fluids and multi-component mixtures described by rigid molecular models. For calculating phase equilibria, different methods are implemented in ms2, such as the grand equilibrium method. Furthermore, it is capable of sampling various classical ensembles and yields numerous thermodynamic properties such as the Helmholtz energy and its derivatives. To evaluate the chemical potential, Widom's test particle method and thermodynamic integration are implemented. Further entropic properties can be obtained using Krikwood-Buff integration method. Transport properties can be determined by equilibrium MD simulations following the Green-Kubo formalism. ms2 is written in Fortran90 and optimized for a fast execution on a broad range of computer architectures, spanning from single processor PCs over PC-clusters and vector computers to high-end parallel machines. The standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) is used for parallelization and ms2 is therefore easily portable onto a broad range of computing platforms.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe self-assembly of colloids is emerging as a promising approach for designing new materials with applications in engineering and biomedical fields. A class of colloidal particles termed lobed colloids can be designed with protrusions (lobes) on their surfaces to provide directionality to interparticle interactions and enhanced excluded volume to facilitate porous self-assemblies. I will present results on self-assembly of several systems of lobed colloidal particles in which different characteristics of these particles, including their shapes, the sizes of their lobes, and the nature of their interparticle interactions, are varied. The systems were studied in either monodisperse (where all particles have the same shape) or polydisperse conditions (binary mixtures of particles with different shapes). The results reveal that the morphology and porosity of the self-assembled structures can be tuned by optimally designing the shapes and interparticle interactions among lobes. The relative size of the central seed particle and the lobes attached to it characterize the seed to lobe size ratio, which is found to be a key shape design parameter to achieve specific morphologies. Moreover, the polydisperse systems formed structures characterized by higher porosities in comparison to the monodisperse systems, which indicates that the composition of the system is also an important design feature for optimal self-assembly into desired morphologies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPolymers are widely used in various industries for their diverse properties, but their limited recyclability raises concerns about their sustainability. Conventional recycling methods are challenged by product quality and cost, highlighting the need for alternative upcycling processes to convert these polymers to value-added products. To improve such processes, efficient solvents must be designed, which is where molecular modeling comes in. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a complementary tool to experimental studies that provides molecular insights into polymer-solvent systems. In this poster, we showcase the power of MD by presenting various fundamental properties to describe polymer behavior in two polar organic solvents: tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dimethylformamide (DMF). These properties include end-to-end distance, radius of gyration, radial distribution functions, shape descriptors, end-to-end vector correlation function, dihedral autocorrelation function, surface area, and electrostatic potential. We investigate the effects of varying chain lengths on the structure and dynamics of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and compare our results to experimental data. Our findings suggest that the PVC120 model accurately represents experimental data when performing atomistic molecular simulations. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of molecular modeling to decode polymer behavior and improve upcycling processes, contributing to the development of more sustainable and efficient materials in various industries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWhen designing proteins or molecules that target proteins, a common issue is thatproteins may dimerize and aggregate, blocking active sites and limiting intended interactions.Hydrophobicity plays an important role in protein aggregation and dimerization, but currentmethods for high resolution mapping of hydrophobicity on protein surfaces are still lacking. Topredict hydrophobicity, we need to understand the surface configuration of proteins. In thispresentation, we develop a patch based characterization of protein surfaces throughrepresentation learning. First, we break down proteins from the PDB database into surfacepatches. Then we construct and train a variational autoencoder to represent patches in a vectorform. Understanding similarities and differences in surface patches begins to suggestrelationships between molecular features and protein function. This is a crucial step towardprotein hydrophobicity mapping because it reduces the latent space of all possible proteinsdown to common surface patches. Mapping the constructed surface patch space allows us tomore easily predict protein function as well as similarities between proteins or different regionsof the same protein.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInverse design is a concept in which a desired set of properties is defined first, and then a material or molecule with those specific properties is designed through a systematic process. For the past 30 years, researchers have been actively studying Computer-Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) technology in the fields of bio-chemical materials and new drug development. Recently, with the application of big data and artificial intelligence technologies, the effectiveness of this technology has been realized. The primary goal of molecular design is to create new materials with improved physical properties compared to existing ones. To achieve this, an optimization process is used to propose a set of molecular structures for new materials or groups of similar materials that are expected to exhibit excellent physical properties. This process significantly reduces the number of materials that need to be synthesized or the range of physical properties that need to be measured through experiments. To maximize the efficiency of the optimization process based on supercomputing, algorithms that allow parallel searching are applied. Molecular dynamics and density functional theory are widely used to predict various properties of a substance based on its molecular structure through calculations, provided that the molecular structure is known through computation. To perform such calculations, a combination of databases and theoretical formulas are utilized. This study covers the basic composition for developing such software, as well as an example of a simple molecular design to test and develop the prototype program through a case study on the design of CO2 absorbent materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe semiconductor industry has experienced significant growth and change in recent years due to the increasing demand for smaller and more powerful devices. To meet this demand, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process has been introduced to create thinner and more precise layers. ALD processes offer high controllability, precise thickness control, and uniform thin film formation over a large area. To better understand and enhance these processes, computational modeling and simulation methodologies are being employed. This study focuses on the simulation of the diffusion and deposition process on the wafer surface using a Stochastic Parallel PARticle Kinetic Simulator (SPPARKS) and the kinetic Monte Carlo technique. Specifically, this study examines the chemical reactions of the chemical species present on the surface and sequentially pulsing and purging the surface with Dichlorosilane and ammonia gas. Adsorption, desorption, and deterioration occur probabilistically, which confirms the expected growth of the atomic layer. The growth of the atomic layer is compared with existing literature. The ultimate objective of this study is to develop a simulation model for a specific chemical species and predict the quality and thickness of the entire wafer under varying conditions, such as different pressures and temperatures. By providing insights into the ALD process and improving the ability to predict the properties of thin films, this study could play a crucial role in the development of smaller and more powerful devices in the semiconductor industry. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the power of computational modeling and simulation in advancing the ALD process. The results provide a foundation for developing a comprehensive simulation model to predict the quality and thickness of thin films on wafers under different conditions. These insights could ultimately enable the development of more precise, reliable, and efficient thin film deposition techniques, leading to the production of smaller and more powerful devices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractProtein-polymer bioconjugates are a class of hybrid biological molecules that strategically utilize the natural specificity of proteins and the synthetic modularity of polymers. Recently, the design and assembly of protein-polymer bioconjugates have gained much attention due to the potential applications of these bioconjugates in drug therapeutics, biomineralization, and biosensing. The conjugation of polymers to protein surfaces can enhance key properties of the biomolecule such as its structural stability and affinity for specific targets, while maintaining its natural biological functions. To optimally design and synthesize these hybrid molecules, the underlying mechanisms that influence their enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic properties must be understood at the molecular level. Computational approaches such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide an excellent entry point for such studies, via the development of accurate and compatible molecular models for studying broad variations of the protein-polymer bioconjugate system.Herein, we showcase the development of a computational framework for systematically building and testing models of protein-polymer bioconjugates that can be readily scaled for high-throughput processing. This methodological workflow encompasses variousin silicotools such as Python, C++, CGENFF, Gaussian, Avogadro, ChemDraw, VMD, and GROMACS. Specifically, we built and tested this framework on bovine alpha-chymotrypsin and hen egg-white lysozyme conjugated with sulfobetaine methacrylamide through atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiators, as well as on human interleukin 12 (IL-12) conjugated with activated polyethylene glycol (PEG). The framework itself, when combined with fundamental analysis methods such as MD, will support the rational design of novel bioconjugates with improved efficacy in terms of function and stability. To this end, we conducted MD simulations of the above bioconjugates in different chemical and biological environments, namely: (1) ATRP-initiated bioconjugates interacting with silica at various temperatures, and (2) PEG-ylated bioconjugates interacting with phospholipid membranes. In the former case, we sought to elucidate structural changes in the bioconjugates that could affect their adsorption to nanoparticle surfaces in drug delivery schemes. In the latter case, we sought to identify adsorption free energy differences between the bioconjugates and their non-conjugated counterparts to inform the use of these bioconjugates in protein therapeutics applications. Finally, through the development of this computational framework, we gained new atomistic insights into advanced protein functions and an improved understanding of the molecular driving forces governing bioconjugate stability.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAmyloid-beta (Aβ) is derived from the neuronal transmembrane protein Amyloid Precursor Protein, following its cleavage by a series of secretases. Self-aggregation of the resulting Aβpeptides into oligomers and plaques has been strongly implicated in mediating neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s disease1. However, recent studies have elucidated manybeneficialfunctions of Aβ, including its ability to repair holes in the blood-brain barrier, regulate synaptic properties of neurons, adopt antimicrobial peptide-like behaviors, and even exhibit antiviral behaviors towards foreign pathogens in the brain. In the latter case, for example, Aβhas been shown to sequester and remove herpes simplex virus (HSV-1)—which affects 67% of the human population—from the brain, via direct interactions with the virus’ surface glycoproteins2. Yet, the full picture of how Aβmediates these antiviral behaviors with respect to HSV-1, and other viral pathogens in the brain, remains unclear.The structure of Aβhas been observed to vary between a mostly unstructured coil in solution, to a helical form after coming into contact with a cellular membrane, to a neurotoxic beta sheet-like structure after the process of self-aggregation has begun. Moreover, Aβcommonly exists as both a 40- and 42-residue peptide, the latter of which is considered to be the more neurotoxic form3, but also the form with the more potent antiviral capabilities. As such, we hypothesized that the 42-residue Aβpeptide that resides in an unstructured or helical form would exhibit the strongest antiviral behavior, binding to HSV-1 glycoproteins in a way that directly interferes with their ability to bind to host cell receptors. To test this idea, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in triplicate using the GROMACS engine, of Aβin the six configurations (40- and 42-residue peptide in a coil, helical, or beta-sheet form), interacting with all four HSV-1 glycoproteins. Our results confirm that specific forms of Aβbind more strongly to HSV-1 glycoproteins than other forms, and that the most strongly-binding forms of Aβinteract with regions of HSV-1 glycoproteins that are crucial for host cell receptor binding. Overall, insights gained from these simulations may be used to guide the future design of novel drugs to prevent and/or treat HSV-1 infection in the brain. More broadly, this work provides a deeper understanding of the innate therapeutic properties of Aβin the brain and may help to elucidate the true role of Aβin other contexts like Alzheimer’s disease.References:[1] Chenet. al, Amyloid beta: structure, biology and structure-based therapeutic development.APS, 38(9):1205-1235.

    "abstract": "AbstractMonte Carlo simulations are carried out to provide molecular-level insights into the retention mechanism in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The stationary phases investigated here include a 9-nm cristobalite silica slit pore and a 9-nm amorphous silica slit pore. The mobile phases are water/acetonitrile mixtures at three compositions (neat acetonitrile, 5 and 10% v/v water in acetonitrile). The analytes include C1-C6 linear alkanes and alcohols. The simulations are performed at two temperatures, 303 and 333 K, and a pressure of 10 MPa. The simulations indicate that the stationary phase is retentive to the hydroxyl group (separating a primary alcohol from the linear alkane with the same number of carbon atoms) since the linear alcohols can form hydrogen bonds with the surface silanols and water molecules adsorbed on the silica surface. The addition of water reduces the retention increment of the OH group because of the stronger solvophilic effect. However, the contribution from the stationary phase to the retention of the OH group does not increase significantly as the water composition increases. Analyses of simulation trajectories provide insights into the structure of the HILIC phases, the orientational distribution of the solvent and analyte molecules, and the propensities of the silanol-analyte, silanol-water, and water-analyte hydrogen bond formation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogels have attracted significant interest in a range of applications due to their complex physical and chemical structures, which enable multiscale interactions. Polyacrylamide hydrogels, in particular, offer a wide range of mechanical properties and exhibit biocompatibility and versatile customization. However, simulating the macroscale properties of hydrogels is challenging due to the intricate multiscale interactions that occur within them.To optimize the effect of each scale while considering the trade-off relationship among them for numerical methods, it is crucial to understand how multiscale structures influence the mechanical properties of hydrogels. In this study, we present a coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach for predicting the elastic modulus of hydrogels based on effective chain lengths of defect-less network structures. We utilized a mixed force-field that accounted for both bonded and non-bonded interactions, with the bonded potentials being extracted from atomistic simulation results and the MARTINI coarse-grained force field used to simulate the non-bonded parts of the hydrogel.Our model utilized coarse-grained potentials to depict the initial deformation of uniaxial tensile, indicating Young’s modulus, while also reflecting the effects of strain rates and swelling ratio on the modulus. Especially, strain rates should be treated with a caution due to rate differences of about 10 to the power of 6 to 10 per second, which could even be related to bond relaxation level inducing an exponential increase in modulus. Plus, the model was constructed with isotropic structures referencing experimental pre-gel conditions, being able to follow elastic properties’ propensity depending on cross linker density.Our findings demonstrate the potential of using coarse-grained molecular dynamics methods to model and predict the elastic properties of hydrogels, despite the inherent randomness in their physical and chemical structures.

    "abstract": "AbstractDevelopment of new materials capable of conducting protons in the absence of water is crucial for improving the performance, reducing the cost, and extending the operating conditions for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. We present an atomistic simulation-based workflow to computationally design fuel cell membrane materials using deep learning potentials (DPs) and graph lattice models (GLMs). Our workflow was used to demonstrate that graphanol (hydroxylated graphane) conducts protons anhydrously with very low diffusion barriers. First, DPs were trained for graphanol that have near-density functional theory accuracy but require a very small fraction of the computational cost. We used these DPs to calculate proton self-diffusion coefficients as a function of temperature, to estimate the overall barrier of proton diffusion, and to characterize the impact of thermal fluctuations as a function of system size. The sensitivity of intrinsic energy barriers to the overall diffusion barrier for proton conduction was further assessed using large-scale GLMs. We discovered, using this workflow, the existence of transient hydrogen-bonded structures, which we indicate asGrotthuss chains, that determine the mechanism of proton conduction in graphanol. We showed that protons can rapidly hop along Grotthuss chains containing several hydroxyl groups aligned such that hydrogen bonds allow for conduction of protons forward and backward along the chain without hydroxyl group rotation. Long-range proton transport only takes place as new Grotthuss chains are formed by rotation of one or more hydroxyl groups in the chain. Thus, the overall diffusion barrier consists of a convolution of the intrinsic proton hopping barrier and the intrinsic hydroxyl rotation barrier. The results obtained from the application of our workflow also enable us to propose specific design rules for developing next-generation proton conducting materials with diffusion barriers lower than existing systems.",

In therapeutic applications, protein associations like the dimerization and hexamerization of insulin play an essential role during transport and storage. To provide insights into insulin's physiological role and to develop more effective strategies for optimizing its stability and efficacy, it is vital to delve deeper into the formation of higher-order structures and the associated dissociation processes. While experimental and computational approaches such as molecular dynamics simulations have been used to understand the aggregation process, atomistic-level details of insulin hexamerization remain elusive. However, it is challenging to study higher-order protein aggregation using classical MD simulations alone, due to the timescales involved. Enhanced sampling methods such as metadynamics are powerful techniques to overcome slow fluctuations in the system and effectively explore the underlying free energy landscape.In this study, we investigate the process of insulin hexamerization by studying dimerization, followed by the association of three dimer pairs to form a hexamer. To effectively probe this process, we construct a new rotational collective variable (CV), which considers protein orientation and rotation relative to one another, offering detailed insights into the underlying association mechanisms. By employing well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD) and parallel bias metadynamics (PB-MetaD), we probe the thermodynamics of insulin dimer and hexamer formation to understand association and dissociation processes.

The method proposed by Behler and Parrinello uses atom-centered symmetric functions (ACSF) to encode both geometric and chemical information, predicting atomic energy with high-dimensional neural networks. While this approach is powerful for fitting interatomic potentials to ab-initio calculations, limited extrapolation capability remains a significant challenge since the computational cost of data acquisition is notoriously high.To address this issue, we introduce a regularization layer based on the analytical bond-order potential (BOP) model, imposing physical inductive bias to the model. Pairwise bond-order parameters are represented as functions of the local atomic environment using neural networks and are utilized in energy prediction with BOP. Our model demonstrates remarkable extrapolation capabilities for potential energy across unseen molecular geometries, which is unprecedented in conventional Behler-Parrinello neural network models.Moreover, our model offers a physically meaningful interpretation of the learned potential energy by decomposing it into pairwise interactions. We validate the energy decomposition by comparing it with the quantum-chemically derived intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI), which shows excellent agreement. We demonstrate the pairwise interaction analysis to the path of the SN2 reaction of methyl halides. It accurately captures the evolution of interatomic interactions throughout the reaction, showing the applicability of model on the study of chemically reactive systems.",

Intuitively, cation and anion doping are regarded as the most efficient way to boost Li-ion diffusion. Another way is to analyze the dynamics of cations and anions through the properties of the structure itself, such as anion rotation in plastic crystals. Here, we explore the mechanism of the anion rotation-assisted Li ion diffusion in various anion frameworks in solid-state electrolytes. The Sulfide framework shows the dynamic motion than the halide one, thereby incrementing the Li-ion diffusion. Also, polyanion frameworks such as [PS4]3-, play a key role in Li-ion mobility. We also investigate the collective motion between the anion and the Li-ion and construct a way to maintain its motion even at room temperature.

    "abstract": "AbstractScientists have traditionally employed trial-and-error methodologies to design novel materials, often complemented by basic heuristic rules or chemical intuition (e.g., “like dissolves like”). However, to date, this simplistic approach has led to the discovery and characterization of only a small fraction of all synthesizable compounds. This limitation is aggravated when studying mixtures, particularly those that show potential in minimizing the environmental impact of the chemical industry, as the number of all possible molecule combinations is virtually infinite. The massive amount of resources and extreme cost necessary to explore this chemical landscape is simply too demanding to be feasible.Data-driven methods such as machine learning are promising alternatives to classical trial-and-error methodologies. The premise of these approaches consists of training machine learning models using existing datasets of known materials, and subsequently applying them to guide the development of new compounds by predicting physicochemical properties relevant to any given target application. However, a severe limitation of this approach lies on the representation of molecules in a machine-intelligible way (i.e., converting molecular structures to sets of numerical values that can be understood by mathematical machine learning models). In fact, most molecular representations proposed in the past lead to overly complex models that require a tremendous volume of experimental data to be properly trained.To bridge the gap between small, scarce datasets and data-driven approaches, this work aims at designing novel sustainable materials using thermodynamics-informed machine learning models, with a particular focus on green solvents. The use of thermodynamics information was achieved in two separate ways. The first was to use Gaussian processes (GPs) and active learning (AL) to describe activity coefficients (a single property), which can then be combined with thermodynamic models to predict a plethora of different solvent-related properties (e.g., phase equilibria). Relying on synthetic data generated from an excess Gibbs energy model, GPs were found to accurately describe the activity coefficients of several binary mixtures across large composition and temperature ranges. Moreover, GPs could estimate their own uncertainty and identify composition/temperature regions where activity coefficient data provides the most information to the models. This was leveraged to build AL algorithms targeted at modelling phase equilibria. In many cases, a single active-learning-acquired data point was sufficient to describe the phase diagrams studied. The ability of AL to greatly reduce the amount of data needed to obtain accurate models was further verified on experimental case studies, namely individual ion activity coefficients, the solid-liquid and vapor-liquid equilibrium of deep eutectic solvents, and phase equilibria in ternary mixtures.The second thermodynamics-informed approach was to develop a molecular descriptor that encodes thermodynamic information, namely molecular polarity, and that possesses a small, fixed size. In this sense, sigma profiles, a type of molecular descriptor obtained through quantum chemistry calculations, were used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that accurately correlate and predict a wide range of physicochemical properties (molar masses, normal boiling temperatures, vapor pressures, densities, refractive indexes, and aqueous solubilities). To boost their performance, the architecture and hyperparameters of each CNN were optimized using a battery of algorithms, particularly Bayesian Optimization and Local Search. Furthermore, it was shown that thermodynamic conditions, namely temperature, can also be used as additional inputs to broaden the applicability of the models.Finally, inverse design workflows based on this type of thermodynamics information (active learning on the sigma profile space) were also constructed, which enable the computational design of tailor-made materials bounded by a set of physicochemical properties selected based on a given application of interest. The results of this work constitute a major breakthrough in the way novel materials can be designed, as the machine learning models developed are robust, accurate, and generic enough to be applied across several families of compounds and materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIonic liquids (ILs), such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM-BF4), have been scrutinized as viable electrolytes for electrochemical reactions due to their highly tunable cation/anion properties, intrinsic conductivity, wide electrochemical stability window, low volatility, and strong electrostatic interactions [1-3]. However, the molecular structure of ILs in bulk and dilute solutions remain poorly understood and prevents the rational design of ILs [4-6]. Molecular simulations can address this problem by modeling the formation of IL nanostructures that is difficult to observe via experiments. Using both the concentration of IL-solvent mixtures knobs, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to quantify concentration-dependent changes in ILstructure. From MD trajectories, we determined how interactions between the IL and solvent impact structure through graph-theoretic representations of IL nanostructure. We show that EMIM-BF4exhibits variations in the tendency to form both charged and neutral molecular-scale clusters as a function of concentration ranging from the dilute to neat regimes. Via these graph-theoretic methods, we investigated quantitative parameters of IL structure (such as length of nonpolar alkyl group) that influence IL structural clustering such as: size of clusters, number of clusters, and number of neutral clusters. These quantitative metrics will permit understanding of how IL structure impacts electrolyte properties which is necessary for fine-tuning electrochemical systems.[1] K. Shimizu, C. E. S.

    "abstract": "AbstractDensity functional theory suffers from self-interaction errors that generally result in the underestimation of chemical reaction barrier heights. This is commonly attributed to the tendency of density functional approximations to overstabilize delocalized densities that typically occur in the stretched bonds of transition state structures. The Perdew–Zunger self-interaction correction (PZSIC) and locally scaled self-interaction correction (LSIC) improve the prediction of barrier heights of chemical reactions, with LSIC giving better accuracy than PZSIC on average. These methods employ an orbital-by-orbital correction scheme to remove the one-electron SIE.In the context of barrier heights, this allows an analysis of how the self-interaction correction (SIC) for each orbital contributes to the calculated barriers using Fermi–Löwdin orbitals. We hypothesize that the SIC contribution to the reaction barrier comes mainly from a limited number of orbitals that are directly involved in bond-breaking and bond-making in the reaction transition state. We call these participant orbitals (POs), in contrast to spectator orbitals (SOs) which are not directly involved in changes to the bonding.We test this hypothesis for the reaction barriers of the BH76 benchmark set of reactions. We find that the stretched-bond orbitals indeed make the largest individual SIC contributions to the barriers. These contributions increase the barrier heights relative to LSDA, which underpredicts the barrier. However, the full stretched-bond hypothesis does not hold in all cases for either PZSIC or LSIC. There are many cases where the total SIC contribution from the SOs is significant and cannot be ignored. The size of the SIC contribution to the barrier height is a key indicator. A large SIC correction is correlated to a large LSDA error in the barrier, showing that PZSIC properly gives larger corrections when corrections are needed most. A comparison of the performance of PZSIC and LSIC shows that the two methods have similar accuracy for reactions with large LSDA errors, but LSIC is clearly better for reactions with small errors. We trace this to an improved description of reaction energies in LSIC.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSaponins are glycosides ubiquitously distributed in the plant kingdom. They have received extensive attention for their potential medicinal value. Recent studies showed that their biological activities are closely modulated by interaction with lipid bilayers. For example, membrane permeation, can directly affect the passive diffusion of saponins, which is also the dominant pathway for saponins to pass through the intestinal tract, blood vessel wall, or other human tissues. Undoubtedly, the absorption of saponin will be directly related to its medicinal efficacy, and clarification of this permeation process is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Here, we combined molecular dynamics simulations with transition-tempered metadynamics to study the permeation process of a monosaccharide saponin (SAM). The time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA) was also applied to design collective variables to accelerate the convergence of free energy profile calculation. Simulations allowed us to characterize the permeation details of saponin through lipid bilayers, which primarily occurs by both hydrophilic interactions of SAM sugar group with lipid headgroups and hydrophobic interactions between SAM aglycone ring and lipid tails. We tentatively proposed the following general permeation mechanism: initially, due to the hydrophilic interaction between the SAM sugar group and lipid headgroups, the molecule approaches the bilayer surface. Then, SAM flips into the bilayer core because of the hydrophobic interaction of SAM aglycone with lipid tails. As the simulation progresses, SAM gradually moves down to the other leaflet and flips again such that its sugar group points towards the lipid/water interface. Finally, through interaction with water, SAM is pulled out of the bilayer. During the permeation process, the lipid bilayer deforms, and water molecules penetrate into hydrophobic core as the SAM flips between leaflets. We carry simulations with different membrane models and found that lipid species modulate the permeation mechanism, resulting in different free energy profiles. In summary, this work provides insights about the permeation process of saponin through lipid bilayers at the atomistic level. Understanding the passive diffusion mechanism of small molecules can also contribute to decrease the cost and time of developing novel antibiotic and anticancer treatments.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations enable prediction of equilibrium structure and properties of complex molecular systems, but slow relaxation times and high computational cost of highly-resolved (all-atom and united atom) representations prohibits the interrogation of many multi-million-atom morphologies. This is where coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) proves useful, as it reduces the computational complexity by grouping atoms into larger simulation elements. Here we focus on the use of non-spherical beads to more accurately capture the structure of materials with complex shapes and directional dependencies that are difficult to represent with spherical simulation elements.We combine machine learning (ML) with CGMD to learn the forces and torques between nonspherical beads that will result in equivalent trajectories to all-atom simulations. A proof-of-concept neural network model is developed using PyTorch for the organic semiconductor PPS, which takes in the relative positions and orientations of atomistic simulations to learn a latent representation of the local pair interactions by incorporating neighbor data. The trained neural network is used to infer the forces and torques acting on coarse-grained simulation elements. We compare the accuracy of models trained against data sets of varying size, and those biased to include configurations where the intermolecular potential gradients are largest. We implement the resulting ML potentials in the HOOMD-Blue simulation engine and compare against all-atom rigid models of PPS quantitatively and qualitatively. We conclude with a discussion of future directions and network architectures that may offer further performance and accuracy enhancements.

    "abstract": "AbstractSignificant efforts have been focused on developing active and selective electrocatalysts to facilitate electrochemical transformations in batteries, electrolysis cells, fuel cells, and carbon capture technologies. It has been known the altering the identity of the ions in the electrolyte has significant effects on the rates and selective on electrocatalytic reactions such as CO2reduction, HER, OER, N2reduction, and water oxidation. Recently, Waegele et al. was able to demonstrate that specifically adsorbed alkali metal cations on Au electrodes not only alter the rate of CO2to CO but is sensitive to the identity of the cation and ability to shed its hydration shell.1Modeling specifically adsorbed cations and its interactions within the electrochemical double layer (EDL) is complex, requiring careful modeling choices on how solvation and electrification within this system to be made. Our prior work for NH to NH2reduction on Rh (111) showed that predicted barriers for this system can vary by 1 eV based on the model parameters used to describe the EDL. In this work, we used a DFT/FF-MD approach to investigate the thermodynamic equilibrium of alkali metal cation adsorption across late transition metal surfaces while identifying the sensitivity made from the choices within our model. We used DFT methods to study the interactions between the cation and electrode and nearby explicit static H2O, representing micro-solvation from the first hydration shell of the adsorbed cation. We utilized a “post-DFT” Helmholtz model to correct the DFT simulation to constant potential and incorporate electrification using two discernable parameters, the dielectric constant and width of the EDL. Force-Field Molecular Dynamics (FF-MD) are incorporated to estimate the dynamic effects of solvation upon cation adsorption, which also informs our Helmholtz model suitable dielectric constants and EDL widths to use.Thermodynamic equilibrium of specific cation adsorption across different late transition metal surfaces are studied by predicting the equilibrium potential (U0), the applied potential of the system where cation adsorption is at equilibrium. We observed that predicted U0’s for alkali metal cations can vary over 1 V-NHE based on the model used to predicted solvation (explicit static H2O, continuum solvation, and FF-MD). For incorporating the interactions of electrification, U0’s are sensitive to the choice of the width and dielectric constant of the EDL, showing variations in U0of 3 V-NHE span for dielectric constants from 2 to 8. Magnitude of the EDL effects can be predicted from the magnitude of the dipole moment change upon adsorption. Lastly, we demonstrate that our DFT/FF-MD approach can rationally tune the model parameter to agree with potential ranges observed on Au (111) from Waegele et al.References:Ovalle et al.

    "abstract": "AbstractCapture of CO2is a critical component in producing valuable reuse products from fossil fuel-based processes. It is generally accepted that current commercial technologies for capturing CO2are too energy intensive and thus cost prohibitive for implementation on coal based power plants. Hence, there is a critical need for development of new materials that can capture CO2reversibly with acceptable energy and cost performance for these applications. Accordingly, solid sorbents have been reported in several previous studies to be promising candidates for CO2sorbent applications through a reversible chemical transformation due to their high CO2absorption capacities at moderate working temperatures. By combining thermodynamic database mining with first principles density functional theory and phonon lattice dynamics calculations, a theoretical screening methodology to identify the most promising CO2sorbent candidates from the vast array of possible solid materials have been proposed and validated at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). The advantage of this method is that it identifies the thermodynamic properties of the CO2capture reaction as a function of temperature and pressure without any experimental input beyond crystallographic structural information of the solid phases involved. The calculated thermodynamic properties of different classes of solid materials versus temperature and pressure changes were further used to evaluate the equilibrium properties for the CO2adsorption/desorption cycles. Per the requirements imposed by the pre- and post- combustion technologies and based on our calculated thermodynamic properties for the CO2capture reactions by the solids of interest, we are able to identify only those solid materials for which lower capture energy costs are expected at the desired pressure and temperature conditions. These CO2sorbent candidates were further considered for experimental validations.However, at a given CO2pressure, the turnover temperature (Tt) of an individual solid capture CO2reaction is fixed and may be outside the operating temperature range (ΔTo) for a particularly capture technology. In order to shift such Ttfor a solid into the range of ΔTo, its corresponding thermodynamic property must be changed by changing its molecular structure by mixing with other materials or doping with other elements. Our results demonstrate that by mixing or doping two or more materials to form a new material, it is possible to synthesize new CO2sorbents which can fit the needs for industrial applications.Recent experimental and calculated results show that some solid sorbents can serve as bi-functional materials: CO2sorbent and CO oxidation catalyst. Such dual functionality could be used for removing both CO and CO2after water-gas-shift to obtain H2with high purity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn the field of programmable self-assembly, where simple building blocks can form highly complex structures following specific local rules of interaction, the desired criteria for these interactions are that they be strong, to enable stable final configurations; specific, to allow for control over which units interact; and long-range, to speed up the assembly process. Embedding different patterns of magnetic dipoles into rigid panels tackles the problem of short-range and weak interactions. The patterning lends specificity to these “magnetic handshake” building blocks, while the magnetic dipoles impart strong, long-range interactions [1]. When assembled, the panels organize hierarchically, first into chains, and then those chains combine to form dense stacks. Differences in the panel types govern the degree of condensation and the order of the observed phase transitions, as well as the final morphologies, allowing us to characterize which panel features lead to structural differences at a larger length scale. We seek to build upon those observations and, by better understanding these kinetic pathways, to obtain control over the emergent structures, as well as the path that the system takes to assemble them. This work will elucidate both kinetic and thermodynamic states of the system, as well as the associated pathways, allowing for the spatiotemporal manipulation of the simple panels into their varied and complex self-assembled final structures.[1] Ran Niu, Chrisy Xiyu Du, Edward Esposito, Jakin Ng, Michael P.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe three-dimensional structure of DNA in the cell nucleus is increasingly recognized as an important factor in disease and development. Interestingly, chromatin organization has been correlated with a number of chemical modifications deposited \"on top of\" the genome (i.e. epi-), spawning the field of epigenetics. These epigenetic modifications do not alter any base pairs, but nevertheless constitute a one-dimensional code which has been hypothesized to template and regulate the three-dimensional folding of DNA. Such patterns of epigenetic marks and DNA structure are highly specific to cell type, organism development, and even disease state. Impressively, multiple experimental techniques have arisen to measure aspects of chromatin structure, such as pairwise contact frequencies. However, no experimental technique furnishes the complete three-dimensional structure. This is further complicated by the fact that chromatin exists in a statistical ensemble of structures, with high variability from cell to cell. We present results using techniques from statistical physics to reconstruct the most likely ensemble of chromatin states consistent with the experimental data. This workflow complements experiments in order to elucidate the structure of chromosomes at increased resolution. With these models, we investigate the sequence-to-structure relationship between epigenetic marks and chromosome structure and ask the question: do epigenetic marks alone carry sufficient information to template three-dimensional chromosome organization?",

    "abstract": "AbstractMetal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as a highly promising class of materials for applications such as gas storage, separation, and catalysis due to their large surface area, tunable pore geometry, and high porosity. However, the practical utilization of MOFs is often limited by the thermal energy generated during the exothermic adsorption process. Unfortunately, the thermal transport properties of MOFs have not been studied extensively, resulting in a lack of fundamental knowledge about the structure-thermal conductivity relationships necessary for designing MOFs with specific thermal properties. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted the first computational high-throughput screening of hypothetical MOFs using classical molecular dynamics simulations and the Green-Kubo method. We screened over 10,000 hypothetical MOFs generated by the ToBaCCo-3.0 code, accounting for significant structural and compositional features, including pore size, density, surface area, node-linker mass mismatch, and metal node connectivity. Our analysis revealed that small pores, high density, small node-linker mass mismatch, and four-connected metal clusters are associated with high thermal conductivity.Furthermore, we trained a graph convolutional neural network on the thermal conductivities of nearly 10,000 hypothetical MOFs. This machine learning model can predict MOF thermal conductivity with a mean absolute error of 0.05 W m-1K-1, which provides an efficient means of exploring the vast design space of MOFs. Additionally, we examined the effect of randomly distributed missing linker and missing cluster defects on the thermal conductivity of UiO-66 and HKUST-1, two well-known MOFs. We also investigated the thermal conductivity of three experimentally determined correlated defect nanodomains of UiO-66 with underlying topologies of bcu, reo, and scu nets. Our findings suggest that both randomly introduced missing linker and missing cluster defects reduce thermal conductivity, while the correlated missing linker defect nanodomain (bcu topology) displayed increased thermal conductivity than pristine UiO-66. Harmonic lattice dynamics calculations also supported these results, indicating an increase in phonon group velocity. In conclusion, our study provides crucial new insights into the design principles of MOFs with tailored thermal properties and highlights the significance of considering structural characteristics and defects when designing high-performance MOFs for various applications. Our application of classical molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, and defect analysis offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and controlling the thermal transport properties of MOFs.",

While antibody flexibility and interface angle have begun to be explored, design rules have yet to emerge, as their impact on the metrics above remains unclear. Furthermore, the purpose of framework mutations in mature antibodies is highly convoluted. To this end, a case study utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was undertaken to determine the impact framework mutations have on theVH-VLinterface. We further sought to elucidate the governing mechanisms by which changes in theVH-VLinterface angle impact structural elements of mature antibodies by looking at root mean squared deviations (RMSD),VH-VLinterface angle, root mean squared fluctuations (RMSF) and solvent exposed surface area (SASA). Overall, our results suggest framework mutations can significantly shift the distribution ofVH-VLinterface angles which leads to increased flexibility by changing which portions of the antibody have a greater solvent exposed surface area. The data highlights the need to reject the dogma of static antibody crystal structures and exemplifies the dynamic nature of these proteins in solution. Findings from this work further demonstrate the importance of framework mutations on antibody structure and lay the foundation for establishing design principles to create antibodies with increased specificity, stability, and breadth.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCompounds with low HOMO‒LUMO gapEgapare in need as they are kinetically unstable making them reactive and desirable for different applications. However, the search for new organic compounds with a lowEgapis an expensive endeavor due to the exponentially increasing pool of virtual compounds. Thus, there is a need to construct a robust, predictive, and computationally inexpensive quantitate structure property relationship (QSPR) to identify and screen for structures possessing lowEgap. Herein, a QSPR is proposed that utilizes atomic Signatures as molecular descriptors correlating the molecular structure with theEgap. A dataset consisting of 112 organic compounds was used to construct the QSPR using forward stepping multilinear regression (FSMLR) with leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), achieving a regression coefficient (r2) and predictability (q2) of 0.86 and 0.76, respectively. The QSPR was able to infer relations between different structural motifs (i.e. atomic Signatures) and theEgap. It was found that the atomic Signature encapsulating aromatic bonds, [C](p[C]p[C][H]), was able to explain around 50% of the variance in the data, showing its significance in affecting the property of interest. The five most significant Signatures were found to negatively affect theEgap, due to them encapsulating π‒bonds, heteroatoms, and aromatics. This is attributed to high electron density, making these structural motifs reactive sites, specifically due to π ‒ π interactions, lone pair electrons, and/or delocalized π‒bonds. In constant the presence of terminal nitrogen or internal alkane chain groups causes an increase in theEgap, which can be attributed to steric hindrance and non‒conjugated bonding. Finally, an external test set were used to further elucidate the predictive ability of the model ‒ anr2of 0.91 was achieved. Overall, the constructed QSPR can be used as a reliable initial screening tool to identify potential candidates possessing lowEgapvalues",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn heterogeneous catalysis, adsorbate-adsorbate interaction can greatly affect reaction rates. Understanding such interactions are crucial for determining intrinsic kinetics and catalytic activity. Herein, we present a model for the interaction among small adsorbates such as C, H, and O on the Pt(111) surface. This model considers the modification of the metal surface and the adsorption strength resulting from other adsorbates in the vicinity of the adsorption site. For the same adsorbates, the binding energy of the metal atoms of the active site decreases as the number of C, H, or O adsorbates in their surroundings on the Pt(111) surface increases. Specifically, the binding energy decreases from -6.4371 to -5.4003 eV for C, from -6.4371 to -6.3351 eV for H, and from -6.4371 to -5.2154 eV for O. It is noteworthy that the presence of other adsorbates can significantly affect the behavior of a specific adsorbate, these effects cannot be explained solely by the electronic structure. The electrostatic interactions among various adsorbates also play a crucial role. Remarkably, the changes in the predicted and calculated C, H, and O adsorption energy on the Pt(111) surface in the presence of other adsorbates exhibit a linear scaling behavior with the number of adsorbates in the surroundings, indicating that the electrostatic interactions among various adsorbates depend on the type and number of interacting adsorbates. When the same type of adsorbates are present, such as C-C, O-O, and H-H, the repulsive nature between them is greater than that between different types of adsorbates, such as C-O, C-H, and O-H. The influence of the electronic and electrostatic components on the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction is more pronounced for C and O, while it is less significant for H. The electronic and electrostatic effects can be determined by simple scaling with number of adsorbates, and the metal binding energies can be utilized to predict the adsorbate binding energies (Figure 1). By considering the electronic and electrostatic components and the presence of different types of adsorbates, the model offers a significant advantage of predicting the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction. Ultimately, this can be achieved without the need for extensive computational calculations, making it a valuable tool for both theoreticians and experimentalists in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.Figure 1: The binding energy of metal (ΔEM), predicted adsorbate binding energy considering changes in the electronic structure and calculated adsorbate binding energy as a function of number of adsorbates present in the surrounding.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe phenomenon of antigen epitopes being specifically recognized by antibodies is not only a critical aspect of our immune response, but is also imperative for vaccine and therapeutic-antibody design. Consequently, detailed characterization and prediction of antigen-antibody interaction is essential for immune system research and treatment strategies. Experimental techniques for capturing the structural details of antigen-antibody complexes, however, can be extremely challenging and resource intensive. Computational modeling is a viable alternative, but current methods for computationally predicting such antigen-antibody docking are based on general protein-protein interaction studies, and only provide global scores of relative performances, without explicit structural rationales. We will demonstrate prototypical examples of how an explainable AI (XAI) based deep learning algorithm can be applied to determine antigen-antibody binding interfaces and interaction parameters. With viral envelope proteins as our study case, we have curated an extensive structural dataset of epitope-paratope complexes and associated binding affinities, and extensively teased out clustering features underpinning these interactions. We have deployed this dataset to enable our machine learning driven predictive models, applying an efficient graph neural network-based method to model docking interfaces in atomistic level. Detailed treatment of covalent bonds, non-bonded interactions, and secondary structural features in defining the interfacial graph extraction preserves the core invariants of antigen-antibody specific conformational information, leading to improved performance. Structural predictions are being further interpreted through XAI methods to understand the underlying sequence-structure-binding relations. This methodology not only gives us a handle over the structural bases of antigen-antibody recognition, but also enables predictive engineering of the interface towards improved therapeutic design.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOver the past decade, alchemical free energy methods have been a popular choice for the computation of solvation free energies and binding free energies, given their ability to connect the end states of interest via nonphysical pathways free from unsurmountable free energy barriers. However, traditional methods like expanded ensemble (EXE) or Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREX) may not be efficient in accurate free energy calculations if the slowest degrees of freedom are largely orthogonal to the alchemical variable. In addition, there exist systems where traversing all alchemical intermediate states is challenging, even if alchemical biases (e.g., in EXE) or coordinate exchanges (e.g., in HREX) are applied. This issue is exacerbated when the state space is multidimensional, which can require seamless communications between hundreds of cores that current parallelization schemes do not fully support.In this study, we present our recent efforts in addressing these two issues separately. First, we proposealchemical metadynamics, which allows explicitly biasing configurational collective variables in alchemical free energy calculations within the metadynamics framework. With test systems with varying complexity, we demonstrate that alchemical metadynamics captures metastable states not necessarily accessible in traditional free energy methods, thus capable of accurate free energy calculations. For the second issue, we introduce the method of synchronousensemble of expanded ensemble (EEXE), which periodically exchanges coordinates of different replicas of EXE simulations. We show that this method can compute free energies consistent with the estimates obtained in EXE and HREX, while offering much higher flexibility. Importantly, its planned successor, asynchronous EEXE, performs parallelized simulations asynchronously, which allows close communications between large numbers of adopted processors, and adaptive changes to the parameters of ensembles in response to data collected. These recent efforts can be easily integrated together in ways such as asynchronous ensemble of alchemical metadynamics, promising enhanced flexibility, parallelizability and configurational sampling for a wider ranges of systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractApolipoprotein E (ApoE), a major scaffold protein in lipoproteins, plays an important role in transporting lipids to microglial surface proteins to regulate brain lipid metabolism. ApoE has three isoforms (ApoE2/3/4), with ApoE4 considered to be the greatest known genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite much experimental evidence illustrating the impact of ApoE isoform on AD pathology, littlein silicowork has been established. This is largely due to the lack of available lipidated ApoE structures, as the only published crystal structure is of unlipidated ApoE3. Herein, we describe the use of two different computational approaches to obtain structures of the different ApoE isoforms in their lipidated forms, which we then rigorously compared to recently published experimental data. Specifically, we employed: (1) steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to bias the hinge regions of ApoE towards a conformation resembling ApoE in its lipidated form, and (2) homology modeling of ApoE against a published crystal structure of ApoA1 in a dimerized, lipid-bound, horseshoe-like conformation. A lipid nanodisc was then added to the structures using CHARMM-GUI, and MD simulations were performed to investigate the feasibility and stability of the structures in solvent. Overall, this work serves to elucidate the molecular-level changes that occur to ApoE as it becomes lipidated, paving the way for futurein silicostudies into the interactions of lipidated ApoE and many different proteins with prominent roles in neurodegenerative disease settings.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPurpose:Adeno-associated virus (AAV) packaging a single-stranded (ssDNA) genome has emerged as a promising vector and is the most common vehicle forin vivogene transfer. They are well established in clinical trials forin vivogene therapy with a good safety profile, low immunogenicity, and long-term stability. Currently, there is limited understanding regarding the mechanism involved in using anion-exchange chromatography to separate empty and full AAV capsids under different pH conditions during purification, as well as the capsids' propensity for adsorption onto the resin material and the role of loaded ssDNA in the adsorption process. Therefore, a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations was conducted to probe the underlying mechanism of the adsorption and interactions between the capsid and strong anion exchange resin, such as polystyrene quaternary ammonium.Methods:The AAV Serotype 8 (AAV8) was chosen as the model viral capsid (PDB: 6v12) with loaded 2kb ssDNA built using the Avogadro software. The initial resin material was constructed and parameterized to the coarse-grained MARTINI force field and model. All the CG-MD simulations were conducted using the GROMACS software package and the trajectories were extracted and analyzed. The steepest descent algorithm was used in energy minimization followed by a 10 ns equilibration step in an isothermal−isochoric ensemble at ambient temperature. The simulation production runs were performed in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble using the Nosé−Hoover thermostat and the Parrinello−Rahman barostat at a pressure of 1 bar for each 10-fs time step. The simulations were carried out using periodic boundary conditions and performed computations in the High Performance Center Supercomputer Cluster at the University of Connecticut.Results:The adsorption behavior of capsid onto the anion-exchange chromatography resin surface at neutral and basic solution conditions was successfully determined using the CG-MD simulations. The analysis of the center-of-mass distance demonstrated that the full capsid bound to the surface more rapidly under basic conditions than other conditions. Conversely, empty capsids did not exhibit any adsorption under neutral conditions. Furthermore, the adsorption process was found to involve multiple asparagine and glutamine as the first amino acid residues to interact with the surface. Among the various conditions tested, the full capsid under higher temperature and basic conditions exhibited the highest level of instability. This instability was indicated by the higher root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values and significant structural changes when binding to the resin, evidenced by the relative shape anisotropy. In addition, the full capsid under basic conditions had approximately 6% more anionic charge on its surface and exhibited much stronger binding interaction energy with the surface compared to the full capsid under neutral conditions.Conclusions:The CG-MD simulations enhanced our understanding of the adsorption mechanism between the AAV capsids and the anion-exchange chromatography. The developed computational model allowed us to evaluate the stability, electrostatic charges, and interaction energy of the empty and the ssDNA-loaded full capsids. Our simulations offered dynamic insights into the structure and energy of the capsids on a microsecond timescale, which revealed behavior that is unattainable through experimental investigations. The CG-MD simulations are demonstrated to be a powerful tool in the simulation of macromolecular complexes capable of guiding the interpretation, explanation, and direction of experiments.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) are important drug targets for inflammation, obesity, and other central nervous system disorders. However, drug design targeting these receptors has been a costly and time-consuming process with a high failure rate due to the off-target side effect. CB2 selective agonists can potentially treat pain and inflammation without the psychological side effects of CB1 agonism. In this project, with the combination of molecular simulation and data-driven modeling, we design selective molecules for CB2.We hypothesize that the subtype selectivity of selective ligands can be explained by ligand binding to the conformationally distinct states between CB1 and CB2. ~700 µs of unbiased simulations are performed to study the activation mechanism of both receptors in the absence of ligands. Using neural network-based VAMPnets, we discretize the conformational ensembles of both receptors into metastable states. Structural and dynamic comparisons of these metastable states allow us to decipher a coarse-grained view of protein activation by revealing sequential conversion between these states. Specifically, we observe the difference in the binding pocket volume of different metastable states of CB1, whereas there are minimal changes observed in CB2. Docking analysis reveals that differential binding pocket volume leads to distinct binding poses and docking affinities of CB2 selective agonists in CB1. Only a few of the intermediate metastable states of CB1 shows high affinity towards CB2 selective agonists. On the other hand, all the CB2 metastable states show a similar affinity for CB2 selective agonists, explaining these ligands' overall higher affinity towards CB2. Furthermore, we performed a data-driven approach for designing CB2 selective ligands. The selectivity of the selective CB2 agonists is decided based on the 100-fold difference of the predicted binding affinity (pKi>2) between CB1 and CB2. The functionality of these molecules is determined based role of the molecules in activating the receptor (agonist/antagonist). We create a predictive data-driven workflow for selectivity using the existing database of cannabinoid assays for binding and function. The latent space obtained from the junction tree variational autoencoder (JTVAE) is used to featurize the molecules for predicted models. This VAE is pre-trained on all class A GPCR ligands (~160K molecules). Based on the stochasticity of the latent space, a data augmentation strategy is used to train prediction models. This strategy is shown to improve the accuracy of the prediction results significantly. The random forest algorithm is used with ten-fold cross-validations for regression and classification. The overall performance (R2 score) of our regression models is more than 0.96. With this network, the entire ZINC20 and ChEMBL databases will be screened. The screened molecules will be further validated by docking into CB1 and CB2 metastable states obtained from our simulations. Overall, with this computational study, we assist the CB2 drug discovery process by mechanistically explaining the subtype selectivity of CB2 selective ligands and designing a workflow for predicting selective molecules.",

However, it still lacks in-depth fundamental understanding of the heterointerface in these heterogeneous bilayers and how this affects their electrochemical performance. In this work, using different computational models (MoS2/Graphene (Gr), MoS2/Gr-O, MoS2/Gr-OH, and MoS2/Gr-COOH) we study Na affinity in the heterointerface and how the different oxygen-functional groups influence the sodium ion battery anode performance of the heterogeneous bilayers. Our density functional theory (DFT) results show that the major descriptor for the Na affinity in heterogeneous bilayers is unveiled as the non-covalent bonding nature, not charge distribution around Na ion. Furthermore, the Na affinity of each functional group at the MoS2/rGO heterointerface is consistent with the trend of the activation barrier of Na. To infer the charge capacity, the phase stabilities are evaluated by adsorbing Na on a single layer of rGO, and the results show that Na-adsorbed rGO has more stable phases than graphene. The epoxy functional group enables maintains not only the charge capacity but also reduces the activation barrier of Na. These discoveries on the relationship between oxygen-functional of rGO in heterogeneous bilayer and their electrochemical performance will motivate the design of advanced anode materials for sodium ion batteries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGas solubility in solvents can be estimated by calculating the excess chemical potential and determining the corresponding Henry’s constant value. Rigorous computational methods implement the Bennett Acceptance Ratio approach to estimate the excess chemical potential. In this approach, the free energy change due to reversible dissolution of the gas is calculated by gradually introducing (or eliminating) the Coulombic and van der Waals’ interactions between the solute and solvent in series of intermediate steps. This process is generally slow and computationally expensive and is inefficient at screening large chemical spaces in a high-throughput manner. Further, it can be used only for solvents with reliable force fields which severely limits its use. This calls for machine learning approaches to predict gas solubility. However, machine learning methods do not necessarily capture the underlying physics of the system and rely heavily on the quantity and quality of training data. In this work, we implement a hybrid approach to test if we can improve the predictive capability of machine learning models by strategically leveraging molecular simulations to expand the dataset. For example, extensive data is available for CO2solubility in linear alkanes, or linear alkyl substituted molecules in general, while data on branched alkanes is limited. In this work we investigate the feasibility of using rigorous molecular simulations on few simple branched chain molecules to generate data that can greatly expand the predictive capabilities of the machine learning model towards branched chain alkyl substituted molecules. We also identify the key features of such molecules whose data facilitates rapid improvement of the model.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDirected-Message Passing Neural Networks (D-MPNNs) are widely used for predicting chemical properties such as solvation thermodynamics, regioselectivity, and reaction barriers and energies However, the vast chemical space poses a challenge for such machine learning models to generalize well beyond the chemistry contained in the training set. One augmentation method that has received growing interest is the application of quantum-mechanical descriptors to D-MPNNs and other ML methods to improve their generalizability and performance. However, such quantum mechanical (QM) descriptors require expensive computational chemical calculations to compute, and it is not well-established which descriptors to use for different property tasks or under what data regimes these descriptors are most impactful. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the impact of QM descriptors on D-MPNN performance for predicting chemical properties across fourteen different datasets. The selected QM descriptors include atom-level properties such as partial charges, spin-densities, and shielding constants, bond-level properties such as bond-length, bond-order, and hybridization characteristics, and molecular-level properties such as HOMO-LUMO gap and multipole moment values. The target datasets include a variety of chemical properties ranging from electronic energy and solubility to toxicity and protein binding affinity, both classification and regression tasks, and a variety of dataset sizes spanning from several hundred to one-hundred thousand data points. We explore the effect of the level of theory, the choice of descriptors on specific property prediction tasks, how to best include descriptors in the D-MPNN framework, how down-sampling within large datasets changes the descriptors’ impact, and differences between using directly computed QM descriptors and descriptors predicted by an additional D-MPNN as part of the workflow. We find that QM-descriptors can have a modest impact on the performance of D-MPNNs when training on small datasets or making predictions on difficult data splits where generalizability is key, but generation of additional data is often of greater benefit to model performance. Nonetheless, the improvement in small data regimes observed can be crucial when integrating ML models intode novoworkflows for automatic molecular design and synthesis where experimental data is often limited. Generalizability is key in such applications as the targets are novel chemical species that are quite different to previously considered compounds. Additionally, even modest improvements in the accuracy of predictions are useful as false positives during synthesis are very expensive. In such applications, incorporating QM descriptors in conjunction with D-MPNNs can be a useful strategy for enhancing chemical property prediction and accelerating the autonomous molecular exploration workflow.",

    "abstract": "AbstractChemistry and materials design frequently involve data of different fidelities to the true property to be optimized, for instance experimental measurements and computational approximations, or simulations at different levels of theory. The different fidelity levels typically involve a cost-accuracy trade-off, where high-fidelity results are relatively expensive or slow to acquire, while low-fidelity results are cheaper and faster but include more bias and/or noise in the data. Low-fidelity data is often useful for covering a broader portion of chemical space in high-throughput virtual screening campaigns in tiered screens (computational funnels). More recently, machine learning has been used to connect low- to high-fidelity data through sequential approaches such as transfer learning [1] and Δ-machine learning [2]. Multi-fidelity methods show some advantages to improve the generalizability of high-fidelity predictions. They are less expensive than Δ-machine learning since they also learn the low-fidelity function, avoiding extra cost at inference; and they leverage the two data fidelities at the same time (compared to transfer learning) [3]. However, many questions regarding when multi-fidelity methods should be expected to perform well remain unanswered, such as the relationship between dataset needs at both fidelities, and how the accuracy mismatch influences the results.To address these questions, we present a comprehensive benchmark of multi-fidelity methods. We systematically add noise and bias to a synthetic dataset and split high- and low-fidelity data in ways that mimic realistic use cases. We also evaluate the multi-fidelity methods on several real-world datasets of optical properties (experiments and time-dependent density functional theory calculations), solubility (experiments and COSMO-RS calculations), and drug efficacy/potency (single-dose and dose-response measurements). We compare the multi-fidelity model performance to transfer learning and Δ-machine learning and provide recommendations for best practices in training models when multiple levels of fidelity are available. Finally, we demonstrate the application of uncertainty quantification and active learning in these models. The more thorough understanding of multi-fidelity methods we develop in this work will allow for more data-efficient molecular and materials design.References:[1]: Vermeire, Florence H., and William H.

    "abstract": "AbstractAccess to models that can predict the yield of organic reactions as a function of reaction conditions is of key importance as it can significantly accelerate the discovery and optimization of new chemical reactions. Recently, the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the emergence of a variety of novel machine learning (ML) approaches, as efficient alternatives to time-consuming experimental screening, for reaction yield prediction [1,2] and reaction condition optimization [3,4]. Although the performance of such ML approaches and their potential roles in predictive chemistry have been demonstrated for specific reaction classes [1-4], their predictive accuracy is often limited by the lack of high-quality data; most of the publicly available data, such as USPTO and Reaxys, typically contain a limited subset of successful experiments at a small range of process conditions, and the concentrations of precursors, reaction times, temperatures and kinetics are only partially or not adequately reported [5]. As a result, the prediction models built upon these databases tend to be highly biased toward reactions with high yields.In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of including unsuccessful reaction outcomes and reaction conditions in the development of ML-based reaction prediction models for amide bond formation. Generic data are extracted from the Reaxys database [6] to test the benchmark performance of the predictive models. In order to achieve accurate and unbiased results, a custom-made (CM) dataset for the amide bond formation is generated by sampling the generic reaction data such that the distribution of yield mimic those of the published high-throughput experimentation (HTE) data set [7]. Having curated the data, the ML-based models for predicting reaction yield [1] and optimizing reaction conditions [3] are trained. Finally, the comparative performance of such models is assessed to evaluate the importance of data quality and to investigate the applicability of CM data for building predictive reaction models.References[1] Schwaller, P., Vaucher, A.C., Laino, T. and Reymond, J.L., 2021.

    "abstract": "AbstractFast and accurate prediction of fluid-phase thermodynamics is an important aspect of molecular discovery and process development. For example, solubility is an essential molecular descriptor in many drug discovery programs, and vapor liquid equilibrium is often a key consideration during the development of separation processes. Over the last fifty years, a variety of predictive thermodynamic methods have been developed ranging from group contribution methods[1, 2, 3] to quantum chemical simulations[4] to machine learning methods.[5, 6, 7, 8] However, there is still a need for methods that can extend to a wide range of compounds without significant tuning from the end user. Currently, group contribution methods require careful and often manual identification of predefined functional groups, while existing quantum mechanical (QM) methods often require significant expertise and computational cost. Machine learning methods have demonstrated promising results in the prediction of thermodynamic quantities such as activity coefficients, yet many lack the thermodynamic consistency of classical thermodynamic models.[9] Recently, it has been shown that using a machine learning model to predict the parameters of a Gibbs Excess model can overcome the challenges of including thermodynamic consistency inside neural networks.[10] We sought to apply the same concept of predicting parameters to an established Equation of State (EoS).In this work, we develop ML-SAFT, a framework for predicting parameters of the PCP-SAFT EoS using machine learning.[11, 12] We were interested in the PCP-SAFT EoS because it can be used for a wide variety of thermodynamic prediction tasks including vapor liquid equilibrium,[11] solubility,[13] and surface tension,[14] yet each new molecule needs to be parametrized by regression to experimental data. To enable training of machine learning models, ML-SAFT includes the largest database of regressed PCP-SAFT parameters published in the literature (969 molecules) and a set of machine learning models trained on this dataset. We extract data from the Dortmund Databank[15] and develop a robust regression method to determine pure component PCP-SAFT parameters from experimental vapor pressure and liquid density data. Within ML-SAFT, we train random forests,[16] feed forward networks and message passing neural networks (MPNNs)[17] to predict the regressed PCP-SAFT parameters.Our results show that random forests obtain the most accurate predictions of the regressed PCP-SAFT parameters. Furthermore, the best prediction of vapor pressure in terms of the average absolute deviation percentage (% AAD) on unseen molecules is obtained from the random forest. However, the best results on density predictions are obtained with parameters predicted by a MPNN. We attribute this difference to the increased representation capability of the MPNN for polar molecules, which we find to be important for density predictions. We also compare ML-SAFT models to two existing predictive PCP-SAFT models: SEPP[4] and group contribution PC-SAFT.[2] We find that ML-SAFT makes accurate predictions for a wider range of molecules than both methods while maintaining computational efficiency.Overall, our work demonstrates that machine learning is a powerful tool for PCP-SAFT parameter prediction. We foresee that the results shown in this work can form a baseline for future work that explores multi-component mixture predictions using PCP-SAFT.References[1] A. Fredenslund, R. L. Jones, J. M.

    "abstract": "AbstractEnzymatic and chemical reactions have distinct synthetic spaces for designing synthetic pathways to target molecules due to the different characteristics between enzymes and chemical catalysts. A recent approach named ASKCOS (hybrid version) combines enzymatic and synthetic templates to obtain hybrid pathways, which demonstrates hybrid search can generate unique promising pathways. However, the use of template makes it only suitable for template-based synthesis planning tools. To address this limitation, we developed a Synthetic Field Score (SFScore) that can determine the appropriate synthetic field for single-step retrosynthesis of a target molecule. We hypothesized that if a compound has been reported in a chemical reaction corpus as a product, the compound is more favorable to be synthesized in the chemical synthetic field, and the same for the enzymatic reaction corpus. We trained a multilayer perceptron on a database of products extracted from an organic reaction database and an enzymatic reaction database. The model provides two scores for enzymatic and chemical synthetic fields, respectively. In the test dataset, the SFScore achieved average recall rates of 89.9%. The SFScore enables the search algorithm to discover more accessible intermediates and pathways within a time frame by avoiding unnecessary synthetic field searches, particularly for complex molecules that require long-step synthetic routes. The versatility of the SFScore allows template-free and template-based retrosynthetic tools to be combined, which leverages the strength of both approaches. In a hybrid search of 400 molecules, combining the template-free retrosynthesis tool named RetroTRAE with the template-based retrosynthesis tool named ASKCOS (enzymatic version) found hybrid pathways to 127 molecules, while entirely template-based ASKCO (hybrid version) found hybrid pathways to 202 molecules with the same terminating conditions. Although RetroTRAE's long search time prevented the pair from finding pathways for more molecules, the unique search space of the template-free tool allowed it to discover 30 molecules’ pathways that ASKCO (hybrid version) could not find.",

    "abstract": "AbstractKnowledge of critical properties, such as critical temperature, pressure, density, and acentric factor, is essential to calculate many different thermodynamic properties of chemical compounds. The values of critical properties are also used in models for mixtures, including for predicting temperature-dependent solvation energies and solubilities. Experiments to determine critical properties are expensive and time intensive, so it is desirable to glean as much information as possible from that hard-won experimental data. Therefore, we compiled/curated a data set of critical property values on 916 pure chemical compounds, and used that data to develop a machine learning (ML) model that can predict critical properties given as input the SMILES representation of a neutral chemical species. We explored directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) and graph attention network as ML architecture choices. Additionally, we investigated featurization with additional atomic and molecular features, multi-task training, and pre-training using estimated data to optimize model performance. Our final model utilizes a D-MPNN layer to learn the molecular representation and is supplemented by Abraham parameters estimated using methods in the literature. A multi-task training scheme was used to train a single model to predict all the critical properties simultaneously with boiling point, melting point, enthalpy of vaporization, and enthalpy of fusion. The model was evaluated on both random and scaffold splits where it shows state-of-the-art accuracies. The extensive critical property data set containing 916 chemical compounds are made available in the public domain along with the model source code that can be used for further exploration.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe lack of efficient discovery tools for advanced functional materials is a major bottleneck to enabling future-generation energy, health, and sustainability technologies. One main factor contributing to this inefficiency is the large combinatorial space of materials which is very sparsely observed. Searches of this large combinatorial space are often biased by expert knowledge and clustered close to material configurations that are known to perform well. Moreover, experimental characterization or first principles quantum mechanical calculations of all possible materials are extremely expensive leading to small data sets that are not suitable for a number of approaches, such as Deep Learning. As a result, there is a need for the development of computational algorithms that can efficiently search this large space for a given material application. Here, we introduce a method that combines a physics-informed belief model with Bayesian optimization. The material is characterized by physical and chemical properties of components of the material in a complex manner buta prioriknowledge of the identity of the important properties is often lacking. The key contributing factor of our proposed framework is in the creation of a hypothesis space with all possible Gaussian process representations of the domain using these different elemental/molecular properties and the ability to select the hypothesis (belief model) that best represents our material design domain. The best hypothesis is then used to perform a search of the material space. Our method is unique since it picks out the physical descriptors that are most representative of the material domain making the search unbiased toward expert knowledge, which in many cases is unknown. The model also provides valuable chemical insight into the domain that can be used to develop new materials that were outside the domain that was initially searched.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBigSMILES is a line notation used to describe complex polymeric systems. However, it does not describe a single system, but rather a family of possible realizations. To address this limitation, we present a compatible expansion of the BigSMILES line notation that adds information to make it generative.With the expanded BigSMILES, the information from the line notation is sufficient to generate a full polymer system from scratch, including molecular weight distributions, percentages of monomers, reactivity and affinity of the monomers, as well as specifications such as solvents and mixtures. This enables the detailed atomistic generation of an ensemble of polymer molecules, providing a starting point for molecular dynamics simulations and the building of digital twins.This expanded notation can also be used to generate initial conditions for high-throughput pipelines that analyze polymers using simulations and/or automated experimentation from a single line input prompt, combining completeness and human readability. Moreover, because the expanded BigSMILES describes exactly one ensemble of (random) polymer molecules, it is possible to determine the probability that a given molecule belongs to the described ensemble. This provides a starting point for training auto-encoders to represent these polymer ensembles for machine learning purposes, closing the loop between generating and quantifying molecules.Overall, the expanded BigSMILES line notation provides a powerful tool for the design and analysis of polymeric systems, allowing for greater automation and efficiency in research and development.",

    "abstract": "AbstractChemo-enzymatic pathway design involves chemical synthesis planning utilizing both enzymatic and non-enzymatic chemical reactions. Combining enzymatic and chemical steps can expand the chemical space accessible for synthesis beyond the capabilities of either set of reactions working independently. However, while molecules like tetrahydrofuran are straightforward to synthesize through chemical means, they can be challenging to produce using biological methods due to issues such as toxicity or a dearth of enzymes capable of catalyzing the necessary reactions. On the other hand, chemistry faces obstacles regarding regioselectivity and the ability to make alterations to complex and heavily functionalized molecules. Therefore, the chemo-enzymatic pathway design approach leveraging both chemical and biochemical reactions for synthesis planning enables the usage of enzymes to catalyze specific reactions and reduce the number of synthetic steps required to produce the target chemical. Recently, numerous studies have shown the advantages of leveraging enzymatic steps into industrial-scale chemical processes such as for the blood sugar regulator Sitagliptin (Merck) and anti-malarial drug Artemisinin (Amyris).However, designing optimal chemo-enzymatic pathways is a complex task that involves encoding and understanding of chemical and biochemical reactions, as well as the knowledge of enzyme substrate activity and specificity. Furthermore, the task is complicated by the high-dimensional search space of potential reactions that combines both chemical/biochemical reactions and the need to optimize for factors such as maximizing yield, minimizing waste, and reducing the use of costly chemicals. Herein, we present a pathway design framework for exploring chemo-enzymatic pathways for chemical synthesis, connecting a starting chemical to the target molecule using both chemical and enzymatic reaction steps. Our approach minimizes the transitions between enzymatic and chemical reactions while designing pathways. The notion behind this concept is that executing these hybrid synthesis routes in experiments necessitates multiple stages of purification and separation of chemicals when there is a transition between enzymatic and chemical reactions. For instance, if a pathway involves a chemical reaction followed by an enzymatic reaction, it entails isolating and purifying the product of the enzymatic reaction to utilize it as the reactant for the subsequent chemical steps. Conversely, if the pathway involves a transition from a chemical to an enzymatic reaction, the purified product of the chemical reaction serves as the reactant for the subsequent enzymatic steps. Therefore, our goal is to reduce these transitions by identifying steps from both chemical and biochemical reactions to create pathways for chemical synthesis. To accomplish this, we use a mixed-integer linear programming algorithm to identify hybrid chemo-enzymatic pathways with the least possible number of such transitions. This approach enables us to investigate chemo-enzymatic routes that require minimal transitions, streamlining the planning of chemical synthesis using hybrid reactions and potentially leading to the development of more effective synthesis strategies. Additionally, our method provides the advantage of exploring an expanded chemical space for chemical synthesis, which could aid researchers in designing more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly synthetic routes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPolymeric membrane design is challenging, and finding new polymer is time-consuming due to the complex interplay of various factors that influence the membrane's performance. Among the various membrane separation techniques, reverse osmosis (RO) is the most common architecture globally, offering excellent performance and simple operation for water desalination. Polyamide (PA)-based polymeric membranes are the current RO membranes in the market where their performance is typically evaluated by water permeability and salt rejection. There is a tradeoff relationship between permeability and water/salt selectivity and the goal of any modification is to push the boundaries of permeability/selectivity tradeoff. The present upper bound correlation defines a trade-off that empirically showcases the current state of the art in separation performance. Surface modifications (e.g., surface coating) is one of the most effective strategy to improve the performance of the PA-RO membranes.Machine learning (ML) models as an effective and cost-saving tool can assist traditional trial-and-error processes to accelerate the discovery of polymers with anisotropic diffusional properties used in membrane fabrication. Though more number of studies have been performed on using ML to predict transport performance of polymeric membrane and accelerate the discovery of high-performance materials used in membranes, modifications of the PA layer of surface RO membrane has not been well explored with ML. To the best of our knowledge, there are still no ML model to modify polyamide layer with a reported ability to increase water permeability of RO membranes. To address this challenge, we explored the potential of ML to enhance water permeability of polyamide RO membrane and pushed the permeability/selectivity tradeoff across the boundary.In this study, we trained an explainable screening ML model on a dataset of different polymers used as the active layer in RO membranes. By applying SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to our model, we identified moieties with positive and negative contributions toward water permeability. We leveraged the results from the SHAP analyses to modify the PA layer of the commercial RO membrane by sharping the intensity of functional groups' peaks with positive effect and suppressing those with negative effect, resulting in a substantial increase in water permeability. The membranes were characterized using FTIR, XPS, SEM analyzer and tested for water permeance, and NaCl rejection using a dead-end stirred cell. Compared to the commercial membrane, the modified membrane improved the water permeance from 1.7 ml/30min to 3.4 ml/30min.Our results demonstrate the potential of ML to replace the traditional trial-and-error to modify polyamide layer of PA-RO membranes for any particular separation application, paving the way for the development of more efficient and sustainable RO membranes for water treatment and purification applications. The proposed approach can be extended to other fields of materials science and engineering, where the identification of novel materials and/or modification of molecular structure with tailored properties is essential.",

    "abstract": "AbstractComputational mechanistic studies of organic chemical reactions combine a model chemistry describing the potential energy surface on which chemical transformations take place together with algorithms for exploring these surfaces with the overall goal of producing reaction pathways, including the relative energies of all minima and potential energy barriers interconnecting them. Secondary goals include minimizing the computer time required to identify reaction pathways, and minimizing user intervention in the reaction pathway identification process. This is typically achieved through the use of local, surface-walking optimization techniques together with a nonlocal path-finding method such as the freezing string method.Here, we describe the use of a neural network potential energy function together with nonlocal path-finding methods for guessing transition state structures connecting two minima. The neural network potential energy function is trained using a dataset of energies computed at the wB97X/6-31G* level of theory (ANI-1) for minimum energy structures of small organic molecules and off-equilibrium conformations obtained by normal mode sampling. We find that, though the calculation of energies along the reaction pathways is out of data distribution, the resulting model is able to qualitatively describe the potential surface along the coordinates of bond-making and breaking reactions.We benchmark this methodology with a set of classic organic reactions and difficult cases. We show how transition state guess structures obtained with this method perform similarly to those obtained by electronic structure theory calculations in local surface-walking algorithms for saddle point searching, as measured by the number of electronic energy gradient calls required to successfully identify the transition state, with some exceptions. There is significantcomputational cost savings during the path-finding optimization by replacing the electronic energy gradients calls with gradients of the neural network potential energy function obtained by automatic differentiation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSolid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a thin layer on the surface of an anode in alithium-ion battery (LiB), serving as a protective layer that prevents the reactions between the electrolyte and anode. A well-formed SEI layer is essential for the stabilityand performance of LiBs. However, SEI degradation is a common problem in LiBs thatcauses reduced performance and safety issues. To understand SEI layer, SEI degradation has been extensively studied by experimental and computational methods. Due tothe limitations of current experimental techniques, the exploration of reactions withinSEI layer relies on computational methods, such as kinetic Mote-Carlo (KMC) method,and density functional theory (DFT). However, compared to experimental data, thesereactions did not comprehensively cover all the products during SEI degradation. Onthe other hand, a more complicated reaction network by Persson was constructed by amachine learning model, which was trained by 5193 species and 86,001,275 reactions.However, this model still could not identify plausible species and reactions in SEIdegradation. Here, an advanced reaction exploration program, Yet Another ReactionProgram (YARP), is applied to explore the reaction network of LiBs. Different fromusing any filter based on chemistry knowledge in machine learning models, the graph-based elementary reaction step is utilized to explore all possible reactions in LiBs. Then, the transition states (TSs) are approximately located by the growing string method (GSM) with GFN2-xTB semi-empirical method (xTB). Finally, these TSs are refined by Berny optimization and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculation to construct the reactions. With the idea of YARP, the reaction network with N-depth (N elementary reaction steps) can be constructed and the feasibility of all reactionsin this network is guaranteed by quantum chemistry.The depth four exploration inethylene carbonate (EC) shows that YARP is able to locate lithium ethylene mono-carbonate (LEMC), lithium ethylene di-carbonate (LEDC), and other byproducts that are consistent with experimental data.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSurfactant – metal interactions are important in applications like corrosion inhibition and synthesis of metallic nanoparticles, wherein surfactants are often added above their critical micelle concentration. Under these conditions, surfactant micelles exist in dynamic equilibrium with free surfactant molecules. Due to their faster diffusion compared to the micelles, free surfactant molecules rapidly adsorb onto metal-water interfaces. Therefore, adsorbing surfactant micelles invariably encounter metal-water inter-faces with some adsorbed surfactants. We have studied, via atomistic simulations, adsorption behavior of micelles of a quaternary ammonium-based surfactant at iron-water interfaces that are partially or fully covered with adsorbed surfactant molecules. We find that on a partially covered surface, a micelle prefers to adsorb on a bare metal patch. On a fully covered surface, the micelle adsorbs on top of already adsorbed molecules and attains a hemispherical morphology. The adsorption free energy decreases as the coverage of iron-water interface with surfactants increases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract**Please refers to the Abstract Figures image file for the figures caption labelIntroduction.In energy applications, when the carbonate rock is weak and poorly consolidated, the hydrocarbon extraction process produces undesired particles which will impact on hydrocarbon productivity and increase environmental waste. Solids production control is essential to mitigate the problem. The solids production risk can be reduced by the injection of formation-strengthening chemicals into the formation. By doing so, the formation compressive strength will be improved through the bonding of formation grains, thereby enhancing the intergranular forces. However, screening the formation strengthening chemicals can be experimentally tedious and time-consuming. In this research, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to screen different polymer candidates. This can be evaluated from the stress-strain response and the adhesion properties from a surrogate polymer-calcite uniaxial tensile simulation study.Simulation Methods.The main component of carbonate formation, calcite, was represented with calcite crystal planes (1 0 4). Classical atomistic MD simulations and pcff+ forcefield were employed to model the interaction of the polymer with the calcite. Polyacrylamide-based polymers were selected as potential candidates, including pure polyacrylamide (PAM), hydrolysed polyacrylamide with 33% charge density (HPAM 33%) and sulfonated polyacrylamide with 33% charge density (SPAM 33%). As a control case, polyethylene (PE), a non-suitable candidate was also modelled as it was used extensively in the polymer-graphene surface system in literature [1] and served as comparison.For each separate case, the polymer matrix was filled between the upper and lower solids surface layer, each consisted of 3 calcite layers. A series of equilibration steps were performed under microcanonical, isobaric-isothermal, and isothermal-constant pressure in z-direction (NPzzAT) ensemble following a temperature quenching process from 500K to 300K at 0 atm. Before the tensile simulation process in the production run, a vacuum region was added on the calcite upper layer, where the upper and lower calcite layers were fixed rigid while the polymer was allowed to move freely as deformable region. In the tensile simulation, the upper layer was pulled upward inz-direction with a velocity of 0.0001Å/fs and the polymer deformed slowly for 800ps. The stress-strain response was measured from the normal force acting on the calcite lower layer normalized by the calcite surface area, and the polymer strength properties were analysed. In a separate simulation, the polymer matrix was frozen, and the stress-strain behaviour was measured with both the polymer and calcite upper layer detached from the lower calcite surface completely, at which the tensile stress measured was surrogate for polymer adhesion strength to the surface.Results and Discussion.The stress-strain response behaviour is depicted inFigure 1, while the polymer deformation behaviour can be observed in the simulation snapshot inFigure 2. For the deformable polymer cases, in general, when the calcite upper layer is pulled upward, the polymer attached to the layer will be pulled together and deform slowly. The reluctance of the polymer to be deformed causes an increase in tensile stress, and when the displacement increases past a critical limit, a void is created in the bulk polymer region. At this stage, the polymer experiences stress failure: the polymer reaches peak tensile stress and decreases drastically due to the damage in the polymer matrix. Preliminary studies shows that the peak stress value recorded for the polymer-calcite system is the same as pure polymer system, which suggests the value is attributed to pure polymer tensile strength. This indicates the polymers can adsorb strongly onto the calcite surface, and the damage failure only occurs in the middle polymer region, but not at the polymer-calcite interface. Hence, the frozen polymer cases are modelled to force the detachment of the polymer from the interface, where the tensile stress recorded is considered as interfacial strength from literature [1].Polyacrylamide-based polymers have amide functional groups that interact strongly with ionic calcite structure. The maximum tensile stress inFigure 1shows that polymer-calcite interfacial strength is significantly stronger than pure bulk polymer strength, validating the polymers can adsorb strongly to the calcite. In particular, the control case of PE has lower interfacial strength compared to other potential candidates. As shown inFigure 2, the PE has weaker adhesion and longer entangled chain away from the surface, while PAM system has stronger adhesion and complete adsorption to surface during the deformation process.Among the potential candidates, the HPAM33% shows better polymer strength due to the presence of carboxylate group in ionized form, which agrees with literature [2]. The results are further validated with the comparison to trend indication from the experimental results as shown inFigure 3, where the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) measured from the experimental study show similar trend to the polymers tensile strength in MD simulations.Conclusion.Uniaxial tensile simulation studies allow the interpretation of the polymer deformation mechanisms and provide insights into the polymer-calcite interfacial strength analysis. It serves as a useful screening simulation tool to evaluate the suitable potential candidates for improved adsorption and formation strengthening performance.ReferencesYuan, Z., et al.,A criterion for the normal properties of graphene/polymer interface.Computational Materials Science, 2016.120: p. 13-20.Thomas, M.M., J.A.

    "abstract": "AbstractNanomaterials including inorganic nanoparticles in liquids or polymers have been actively researched as highly-functional materials. For example, nanofluids are expected to be applied to coolant and conductive nano-ink, and polymer nanocomposites are expected to be applied to automobile parts, thermal interface materials, and optical thin films. To control the properties of these materials, it is important to control the dispersion state and spatial distribution of nanoparticles in host materials. Surface modification of nanoparticles with organic molecules is one of the effective technologies for controlling an affinity between nanoparticles and dispersed media, i.e., the dispersibility of nanoparticles. However, a design guideline for suitable surface modification is not well established because it is difficult to directly measure the affinity between surface-modified nanoparticles and dispersed media through experiments with high accuracy. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted for the interface between organic-modified inorganic solid and organic solvent to evaluate the interfacial structure and affinity.All-atom MD simulations were performed for organic-modified inorganic solid substrate/organic solvent interfaces to simulate a part of a nanoparticle surface. The inorganic solid wasα-Al2O3(0001), the modifier was carboxylic acid with different chain lengths, and the solvent wasn-alkane, also with different chain lengths. The surface coverage of modifier was 100% (4.8 molecules/nm2) and 50%. The simulation systems were equilibrated at 300 K and 1 MPa. Work of adhesion was selected as a measure of interfacial affinity, and calculated by using the phantom-wall method, which is a kind of thermodynamic integration method. All simulations were conducted by using LAMMPS.The effect of modifier chain length and solvent chain length on the work of adhesion was investigated. For the surface coverage of 100%, the work of adhesion remained almost unchanged because the solvent did not penetrate the modifier layer. For the surface coverage of 50%, the work of adhesion was maximum in the case of decanoic acid modifier. The longer the solvent chain length was, the larger the work of adhesion was. To evaluate the degree of solvent penetration to the modifier layer, the overlap parameter was calculated by using the density profile at the interface. The work of adhesion for various carboxylic acid-modified Al2O3/n-alkane systems was mostly correlated with the overlap parameter. Therefore, a high interfacial affinity can be achieved by appropriately selecting the modifier and the surface coverage to increase solvent penetration.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDeep saline aquifers seem to be a very promising solution for large-scale hydrogen storage (following a Power-to-Gas process) due to their capacity, their storage over a long period (providing sufficient storage capacity for seasonal energy demands) and their geographical availability [1, 2]. Given the limited knowledge of this type of storage, it is important to study the different phenomena that can impact the quality of the stored gas. In aquifers, the interaction between gas, brine and rock can lead to various physicochemical and biochemical phenomena that can impact the stability and mobility of hydrogen, including dissolution, diffusion and reactivity, etc. To study and develop such infrastructure, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding and quantification of the thermophysical properties involved, such as gas/liquid solubility, diffusion, interfacial tension, and others [3].For reasons of complexity, cost and hazardousness, experimental studies on the thermophysical properties of H2/NaCl brine systems are limited. Few studies (2 experimental and 2 molecular simulation studies) were performed on the phase equilibria of H2/NaCl brine systems [4-7], showing significant discrepancies, and only recently interfacial tension were evaluated [8, 9]. Regarding the transport properties, no experimental studies are available for the self-diffusivity of H2/H2O/NaCl mixtures, and only one recent molecular simulation study has been published [7]. Furthermore, almost no studies deal with more representative systems consisting of mixtures of gases (H2, CH4, CO2, etc.) and ionic species in the formation water.In this work, new equilibrium data for H2/gas/brine systems are predicted using Monte Carlo simulation with different approaches [10]: Gibbs ensemble method (direct method) and single NPT simulation using Henry's law method (indirect method). The effect of density and excess properties on solubility prediction is studied using different force fields for hydrogen, gas, water and salt ions. In addition, the possible influence of clay interlayer on the solubilities is explored. Using molecular dynamics, new data on self-diffusivity and interfacial tension for H2/NaCl brine systems are provided for a wide range of conditions relevant to underground hydrogen storage in porous media.After validation against laboratory experiments, data are used to develop thermodynamic models with different approaches (gamma-phi and phi-phi approaches) and transport properties correlations. The developed models can be implemented in large-scale simulation tools, providing a more reliable representation of thermophysical property data and a better estimation of storage capacities and sealing integrity.ReferencesRaad, S.M.J., Y.

    "abstract": "AbstractRecovery and recycling of electronic waste (e-waste) involves leaching to dissolve valuable metals as a key intermediate process. Preprocessing is required to mechanically size reduce and screen the raw e-waste to generate fine powders with improved metal concentration as feedstocks for leaching. The leaching efficiency largely depends on narrow particle size distribution (PSD), high sphericity and moderate surface wettability of the powders to form uniform pore networks and high-saturation percolation. However, the current e-waste leaching efficiency is not well understood or predicted, because of the poor powder qualities (wide PSD, large aspect ratio (AR) shapes, etc.); those result in heaps with preferential flow paths (short circuit) and low pore saturation, dissolving low metal content and requiring more re-circulations – a critical barrier for scaleup of the process. Improving leaching by using high-quality powders can be guided by computational simulations of percolation in realistic powder packing, which is relatively an unexplored area. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are not possible for the computing cost required for the relevant length and time scales. Continuum-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are also not suitable, as they are not capable of resolving micron-scale pore-mediated wetting. This work uses a many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD) model as a coarse-grained molecular flow model for multiphase simulations of percolation through pore networks formed by micron-sized e-waste powders. The model parameters are calibrated to exhibit the properties of realistic leaching fluids. Parametric simulation studies focusing on the influence of surface wettability and pore size and shape on the flux and saturation during percolation are performed. Criticality of the tested fluid properties and powder attributes as well as the processing parameters on the percolation performance will be reported and discussed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSchool of Chemical, Biological, and Materials EngineeringThe University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73071Bicontinuous Interfacially Jammed Emulsion Gels, also known asBijels, find many applications in the industry including catalysis, separation processes and tissue engineering [1]. Recently, they have been considered as options for reactive separation media due to their large interfacial areas and ease of removal and insertion of reagents and products. In this work, polymer transport throughBijel structureis investigated through the use of Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) computations, which is available through the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) software package [2-5]. The two fluid phases are water and diethyl phthalate, stabilized with neutrally wetting nanoparticles. Surface parameters, such as interfacial tension and contact angle, are measured using the DPD coarse grained simulations in order to validate the computations and to guaranteeBijelstability [6]. Thereby, the interactions between the immiscible phases and the jammed nanoparticles can be evaluated. By the insertion of intra-bead interaction potentials, a multimeric molecule is modelled in DPD focusing on conformation identities such as the radius of gyration. The presentation will focus on the selection of the DPD model parameters that mostly affect the multimer conformation properties as a function of DPD beads. The discussion will include the calculation of the multimer diffusivity in each of the water and oil phases, and then the diffusivity across the oil-water interface. The mass transport coefficient as a function of the polymer-solvent interactions and the interfacial tension on the bijel system is obtained in order to model the migration of lipophilic compounds from the water to the oil phase.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe support of NSF under grant EFRI-2132141 is gratefully acknowledged as the use of computing facilities at the University of Oklahoma Supercomputing Center for Education and Research (OSCER) and at XSEDE (under allocation CTS-090025).REFERENCESCha, S., Lim, H.

    "abstract": "AbstractHeterogeneous catalysts exhibit significant changes in composition due to the influence of operating conditions, and these compositional changes can have significant effects on catalytic performance. For bulk metal heterogeneous catalysts, relationships between composition and catalytic operating conditions are well documented, such as the relationship between coverage and structure with operating conditions on bulk metal surfaces. However, at present, the influence of operating conditions on the compositions of single-site heterogeneous catalysts remains largely unresolved due to the tunability and variability of the ligand environment of the active site. Single-site heterogeneous catalysts are highly attractive due to improved metal utilization and tunability; however, chemical intuition about the influence of operating conditions on compositions and structures of single-site heterogeneous catalysts hinders their design and rational optimization. To address this, we combined computational and experimental characterization of a Ni-oxo (Ni4OxHYclusters) catalyst under catalytic hydrogenation conditions. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis is combined withab initiothermodynamic modeling to investigate ligand environments present on a Ni-oxo cluster supported in the NU-1000 metal−organic framework. Experimental PDFs provide insights into both the Ni-O coordination numbers and the Ni−O, Ni···Ni, and Ni···Zr distances, which are key in understanding the molecular structure of the catalyst. These measurements are compared directly to simulated PDFs from Density Functional Theory (DFT) optimized calculations (a total of 854 different ligand environments). Our findings suggest significant OH and H2O content, and that different Ni ions within the cluster and/or NU-1000 structure may comprise subtly different numbers of these ligands. The observation of significant H2O content even under H2(g) conditions suggests that the support (NU-1000) supplies H2O to the cluster. The combination of simulations and experiments provides new insights into the ligand environment for Ni-NU-1000 catalysts that will be useful for understanding the ligand environments of other single-site Ni catalysts as well.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFurfural acetalization reaction on well-defined Pd nanostructures showed structure sensitivity with respect to the particle shape. The acetalization reaction was performed over Pd cubes (~ 22 nm), octahedras (~ 26 nm) (Figure 1(a) and (b)) and spheres (~ 25 nm) at 303 K and 5 bar H2pressure for 3 hours in different solvents (ethanol, methanol, butanol and propanol). Pd cubes (exposing only the (100) facet) exhibited high furfural conversion (80%) and acetal selectivity (93%) compared to Pd octahedras (exposing only the (111) facets) (35% and 77%) and Pd Spheres (exposing both (111) and (100) facets) (41% and 75%) in ethanol as the solvent. The furfural acetalization reaction on Pd cubes was further studied in presence of methanol, propanol and butanol. The reactivity trend for different solvents followed the order: methanol (95%) > ethanol (80%) > propanol (62%) > butanol (56%).ab-initioDensity Functional Theory (DFT) calculations further provided a mechanistic insight into the reactivity of two different Pd facets (100) and (111) towards furfural acetalization reaction at high coverage of solvents. DFT calculations showed that the binding energy of furfural on Pd (100) (Eb= -172.7 kJ/mol) (Figure 1 (c)) was higher than Pd (111) surface (Eb= -114.8 kJ/mol) (Figure 1(d)). On both the surfaces furfural acetal product was observed to be formed in three steps: alcohol dissociation into alkoxy intermediate followed by hydrogenation of carbonyl oxygen of furfural to form alkyl furan and nucleophilic addition of alkoxy group on the carbonyl carbon of alkyl furan to form acetal product (Figure 1(e)). The ethanol dissociation, furfural hydrogenation and acetalization step exhibited least barriers on Pd(100) (51.6, 27.7 and 77.2 kJ/mol) compared to Pd (111) surface (78.6, 35.8 and 92.2 kJ/mol) in presence of full coverage of ethanol. Calculated values of activation barriers for the three steps were significantly reduced on the Pd cubes in presence of methanol as the solvent(47.8, 24.2 and 64.6 kJ/mol) which was consistent with the experimental results.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSelexol is a physical solvent, which can be used to selectively remove acid gases, such as CO2and H2S from a variety of natural and synthesis gas streams[1,2]. Selexol is very hydrophilic, which could absorb water from the gas stream and as a result to unfavorably decrease its performance in CO2capture[3]. In order to conduct reliable process modeling to analyze CO2capture in H2production using the Selexol solvent compared with hydrophobic solvents (such as diethyl sebacate[3]), thermophysical properties of Selexol and its interactions with other gas components, such as H2O, CO2, and H2are needed.In this work, we studied various physical properties both from molecular simulations and experiments, such as gas absorption Henry’s law constants and diffusivities for H2O, CO2, and H2in Selexol at 298-373 K, excess molar volume for solvent mixture, viscosities, and vapor pressures. Both simulations and the experimental data show that H2O-Selexol solvent mixture exhibits the largest negative excess molar volume of 1.5-2.5 cm3/mol at 298 K and a water mole fraction of 0.83. At this specific water mole fraction, large clusters formed between water and Selexol molecules were observed from simulations, which could maximize water-Selexol interaction and leads to the largest negative excess molar volume. In addition, At about this water concentration, both simulations and experimental data show that the water-Selexol mixture exhibit higher viscosity than at other water concentrations. Simulations show that CO2/H2solubility selectivity in Selexol decreases from 88 ± 1 at 298 K to 39.2 ± 0.3 at 373 K, which are due to decreased CO2solubility however increase H2solubility at elevated temperatures. In the Henry’s law constant region, both simulations and experimental data show that H2O/CO2solubility selectivity is between 100-10000, indicating that Selexol is indeed very hydrophilic. At 298-373 K, simulations show that gas diffuses in the following relative order: H2(100) > CO2(10) > H2O (1). Although Selexol and diethyl sebacate exhibit similar viscosities, both simulations and experimental data suggest that CO2diffusivities in diethyl sebacate is 4-5 times smaller than in Selexol. The vapor pressure for Selexol (a mixture of different chains of (CH2CH2O)n) obtained from solvation free energy calculation was computed to be 0.02 ± 0.01 Pa at 298 K, comparable to the literature experimental value of 0.097 Pa. These findings suggest that Selexol is very non-volatile. In addition, at 298 K, the lightest component (CAS 112-49-2) is the predominant component in the gas phase; other heavier components have negligibly small concentrations in the gas phase. When the temperature is increased to 373 K, the saturation vapor pressure was estimated to be 22 ± 3 Pa, with a partial pressure of 19 Pa for CAS 112-49-2, and 3 Pa for the heavier CAS 143-24-8, respectively. Finally, calculations show that the solvation free energies for different components in Selexol correlate linearly very well with the number of repeat units for (CH2CH2O).References:Ashkanani, H.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe growing population has led to a rise in demand for freshwater and other natural resources. TSSE, initially proposed in the 1960s for low-salinity brine desalination, has lately been found to be an effective method for desalinating high-salinity brine. Despite some attempts to study the TSSE performance of various amine-based solvents, the molecular properties of the best candidates for this solvent-based desalination method remain unknown. Using molecular simulation data and an unsupervised learning method, the molecular characteristics of 60 different amine-based solvents are analyzed. The results showed that the solvents are grouped into four clusters based on thermodynamic properties such as density, heat of vaporization, volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, solvent-solvent binding free energy, solvation free energy, and number of h-bonded sites. Additional brine-water interfacial simulations are conducted, and it is found that among the 59 amine-based solvents, secondary amines with a six-carbon branched or linear structure had the most promising TSSE performance.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPolymer materials are extensively used in a wide variety of domestic and industrial applications, including energy storage, membranes, biomedical applications, etc1,2. Despite significant progress in new materials development over the past few decades, exploring the polymer space still holds strong potential due to the variability of monomer structure and polymerization methods, making the design space infinitely large. To meet the demand for better polymer materials with enhanced thermal, mechanical, optical, and electronic properties, as well as ease of synthesis and production, computational modeling has been used to simulate polymerization and polymer molecules, and can be used to support experimental efforts by providing guidance for more rational experiment design3–5.However, traditionally, polymerization modeling and polymer molecular simulation have been treated as separate subjects, resulting in suboptimal or infeasible design. Thus, an integrated computational framework for closed-loop polymer design is highly desirable, yet challenging to achieve due to the gaps in information and time scale of different simulation methods.In this work, we present our efforts towards an integrated framework for designing polymerization recipes and targeting polymer material properties. We improved the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm and combined it with an active learning algorithm to design the polymer chain sequence distribution efficiently. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulation was then used to connect the polymer chain information with the thermal and mechanical properties of the polymer material. Additionally, machine learning algorithms were employed to approximate molecular dynamic simulations and better unite the time scales of polymerization modeling and polymer molecular simulations. Our work is a first step towards an end-to-end computational framework for polymer materials design, with the potential to extend the scope of materials and connect with experiments.Reference(1) Ali, U.; Karim, K.

    "abstract": "AbstractWhen performing molecular dynamic simulations, lowering the time and energy spent on calculations can be very valuable. One way of reducing time spent on simulations is by eliminating the need of simulating systems at different conditions, which can be accomplished by identification of isomorphs1. Isomorphs refer to a set of equivalent state points in which structure and dynamics are invariant. They effectively reduce a two-dimensional thermodynamic phase diagram to one dimension; this allows for the mapping of properties of a system at one point to another point without need of running a simulation at the other point. Currently, there are a number of methods used for isomorph identification, but the focus of the presented work is on the potential of using configurational temperature, Tconf2, for isomorph identification.The most fool-proof method of isomorph identification is the gamma (γ) method, in which the main property of an isomorph is employed – constant excess entropy along the isomorph. Although reliable, this method is expensive as it requires a simulation from which γ can be calculated, γ being the correlation coefficient between the potential energy function and the instantaneous virial1. There are other methods for isomorph identification, all of which have varying degrees of speed compared to the γ method, but the focus of this work is on exploring the viability of using configurational temperature, Tconf, for isomorph identification, which requires only one equilibrated configuration from one simulation. To this end, we have seen success with single-particle Lennard-Jones systems, but the presented work expands to include one, two, and three component systems.Chem.

    "abstract": "AbstractGas hydrates are crystalline structures that are made of water (host) cages encapsulating the gas (guest) molecules. Methane hydrates are mostly found in the deep sea and permafrost regions; and are a source of fossil fuel where the estimated amount of carbon content trapped in hydrate reservoirs globally is twice that present in conventional fossil fuels[1]. Methane recovery from hydrate reservoirs using CO2injection has gained attention in the past few decades owing to its potential to suffice energy requirements and sequester carbon dioxide[1]. However, due to differences in hydrate forming conditions between methane and carbon dioxide hydrates full recovery of methane from the reservoirs cannot be achieved, as result residual quantities of mixed (CO2+ CH4) hydrates, CH4hydrates, CO2hydrates, CH4and CO2gases may remain in the hydrate reservoir. Although methane hydrates and carbon dioxide hydrates have been extensively studied in the literature, not many studies are available demonstrating the behavior of mixed gas hydrates[2], [3]. Therefore, in our work, we are studying the effect of various parameters, such as salinity, CO2concentration in the aqueous liquid phase, and temperature which shall affect the stability of mixed gas hydrates in the reservoir. To achieve this, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations (by employing GROMACS open source software package) of the mixed hydrate in contact with liquid water (H-Lwphase) in the NpT ensemble at a fixed pressure of 30.5 bar and temperatures of 250 and 273 K. We have observed the effect of addition of salts in the aqueous phase, supersaturation of CO2in the aqueous phase, and combined effect of both, on mixed hydrate behavior at both 250 and 273 K. Simulations have been performed using all-atom forcefields for water (TIP4P/2005), carbon dioxide (TraPPE Flexible), methane (TraPPE-EH Flexible) and NaCl to capture a reliable and effective description of the interactions present in the system. At low temperatures (250 K) in the presence of supersaturated CO2in the aqueous phase, growth of CO2hydrate has been observed. Order parameter analysis has been used to estimate the variation in the thickness of the hydrate with time and eventually the velocity of the hydrate front during growth has been calculated. The interface width at both interfaces has been observed to be invariant with time. However, at the same low-temperature condition, when salt was present along with supersaturated CO2in the aqueous phase, the growth of the hydrate is limited up to a few nanoseconds, and eventually, gas nanobubbles were formed. This confirms the role of salts in inhibiting the growth of the mixed hydrate. Hydrogen bonding and local order parameter analysis suggest that salts disrupt the hydrogen bonding between water molecules required to form the hydrate cages, thereby inhibiting the growth of the hydrate. Two-dimensional mass density profiles are used to understand the mechanism of nanobubble growth by measuring its change in radius with time. At low-temperature conditions, when neither CO2nor salts were present in the aqueous phase, the formation of ice was detected. However, when only salts and no CO2were added to the aqueous phase at the same temperature condition, no significant drop in the fraction of solid water was observed. This result is interesting by itself as it suggests a possible difference in the effect of salts in the presence and absence of an aqueous solution supersaturated with CO2at low temperatures. At the high-temperature condition (273 K), dissociation of the mixed hydrate was observed. However, when the liquid water phase was supersaturated with CO2at the same condition, a cylindrical nanobubble was observed. This is due to decreased solubility of CO2in the aqueous phase at high temperatures. Here, we attempt to explain the role of a mixture of guest molecules in the hydrates using interaction energies, the possible difference in the mechanism of growth and dissociation by studying interfaces, and the role of salt concentration in growth and dissociation by looking at hydration shells around ions and orientation of water molecules in the hydration shells. The work presented here will help to gain molecular insights for efficient methane recovery from and carbon dioxide sequestration in the hydrate reservoir by carbon dioxide injection.References[1] W.

    "abstract": "AbstractIn Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation of protons in water is used to probe the state of bodily tissues. The contrast in these images is enhanced by Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) that act by reducing the water proton relaxation time. However, despite the long history of NMR, the molecular-scale processes in NMR and MRI remain poorly understood; the modeling and interpretation of the physics of relaxation still rely on severe assumptions. Further complicating matters, different tissues present different relaxation times due to variation in the physical and chemical environment, including nano-confinement, presence of osmolytes, electrolytes, and dissolved oxygen; the effect of such complexity is also not understood. In this work, we employ quantum and molecular simulations to investigate the effect of osmolytes on the NMR relaxation of gadolinium(III)-aqua complex and Gadavist®. Our simulation results are corroborated and validated by NMR relaxation dispersion measurements. We investigated the roles of urea and TMAO; urea is a well-known denaturant of protein structure, while TMAO has a stabilizing effect on protein structures. Our investigations show that such osmolytes can influence the NMR relaxation of gadolinium(III) complexes. In this presentation we will discuss these results. Further, we will discuss how the NMR relaxation signal can be decomposed into contributions from dynamical “molecular modes,” a technique that can prove powerful in building a library of signals to interpret NMR and MRI signals in otherwise hard to analyze environments.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPolymers are one of the most diverse classes of materials thanks to the nearly infinite number of combinations of structures possible due to a variety of characteristics of polymer synthesis including the ability to utilize numerous different polymerization approaches available today, the wide array of monomer chemistries and architectures that are easily synthesized, the numerous polymer architectures beyond linear homopolymers that are available through various techniques such as the use of branching chemistries, and the relative ease of enchaining various combinations of different monomers along a polymer chain. Although this flexibility to exquisitely control and tailor polymer structure makes this class of materials well-suited to solve a variety of engineering challenges across a variety of application areas, the size of the polymer design space also presents a significant challenge when tasked with determining the best polymer structure to produce that can satisfy the property and processing requirements for a particular problem. With the dramatic gains in computational capability in recent years, molecular modeling has finally transitioned from a tool that can be used for predictive design and optimization of polymer structure as opposed to most past use cases where it was best suited to explore either general polymer behavior or to semi-quantitatively match and explain experimental data for real polymer systems in hindsight. Thus, the ability to develop of reliable predictive computational models for the behavior and properties of real polymer systems is of great importance for the current and future design and optimization of new materials. In this work, a methodology is presented which can be used to develop improved atomistic and coarse-grained force fields for molecular dynamics simulation of real polymers. Furthermore, an efficient method for producing initial conformational states in dense linear polymer simulations is also presented.The first challenge when creating polymer molecular dynamics simulations that are expected to quantitatively match, and better yet predict, polymer properties is the selection of a force field to represent the interactions of the atoms and/or coarse-grained structural elements of the polymer. There is in general always a need for the ability to conduct accurate atomistic MD simulation of polymers. In some cases, such atomistic simulations can be useful themselves and in other cases they can be useful for parameterizing and training coarse-grained models that can allow for larger time and spatial scale simulations. In this work, an improved force-field is developed for the simulation of linear hydrocarbon polymers based on initial use of the OPLS force-field with various refinement and optimization approaches. The end result, as will be demonstrated from the results presented for several exemplar linear homopolymers including polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyisoprene (PI), is a force-field which can reproduce the physiochemical properties of such linear hydrocarbon polymers with significantly improved accuracy. Once such improved atomistic force-fields and simulation were available, these capabilities were then utilized to develop improved coarse-grained models for such linear hydrocarbon polymer systems. In particular, models that allow for higher levels of coarse graining while retaining the ability to predict important polymer structural and physical properties were explored and developed. The general methodology used for this coarse-grained model development will be presented and the specific coarse-grained models developed for PS, PP, and PI will be presented along with a discussion of the ability of such coarse-grained models to accurately reproduce the behavior and properties of these polymer systems.An often underappreciated challenge in such polymer modeling problems is the ability to generate realistic polymer conformations for polymers at their experimental density. This paper will also discuss the importance of such polymer conformations with respect to the general ability to produce accurate molecular dynamics models for linear polymer systems that can reproduce the properties of well characterized polymer systems (i.e. PS, PP, and PI). Improved methodologies for generating initial conformations for use in atomistically detailed simulations of dense polymer systems will be discussed and benchmarked in detail.The end result of this work is a set of methodologies and both atomistic and coarse-grained polymer simulation models that can reproduce a wide variety of the physiochemical properties of linear hydrocarbon polymers. The future potential to extend this work to both other known and as of yet to be synthesized polymer systems will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) is an important fast oxygen ion conductor. O2−-ion hopping in different cation environments of GDC is probed using molecular dynamics (MD). We find that at equilibrium, the O2−-ions and vacancy defects arrange themselves around the relatively immobile cations in a way such that pairs of O2−-ions and vacancy defect (O2−–vac pair) are in greater numbers in some cation environments than others. The difference in O2−–vac pair numbers is shown to originate from entropic effects in the cation environments. As a consequence of the entropic effect, the O2−–vac pair distribution is practically independent of temperature between 974 and 1874 K. Even the O2−ion hopping rate and barrier are influenced by the entropic effect. This observation is in stark contrast with the standard belief that energetic interactions dominate in solid oxide materials, and entropic factors can be ignored. By analyzing the cation environment effect usingk-means clustering, nine environment clusters are identified that are associated with unique values of the activation barrier and entropy. Comparisons to yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), yet another popular fast oxygen ion conductor, are made.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe extremely low dispersibility of the carboxylic acid cellulose nanocrystals (CNC-COOH) in non-aqueous organic solvents prevented their massive utilization in many research or industrial areas. For example, despite the high affinity of the CNC-COOHs to stabilize graphene flakes, their low dispersibility in ethanol forbids their integration into graphene-based inks formulated in the ethanol solvent. To the best of our knowledge, the improvement of CNC-COOH’s dispersibility in organic solvents using covalent surface modification has not been investigated. Hence, in the current study, we carried out molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the impacts of the surface functionalization on CNC's dispersibility, and compared the results against our experimental measurements. Our potential of mean force (PMF) calculations revealed functionalization of CNC-COOHs with alkyl groups (CNC-COOH-alkyl), e.g., ethyl, butyl, hexyl, and octyl, enhances dispersibility in ethanol compared to the pristine CNC, either due to the reduced strength between the binding partners or a developed kinetic barrier along the binding pathway.Our experimental dispersibility tests confirmed our simulation predictions, wherein the alkyl chain length increment increased the dispersibility. The well dispersion of CNC-COOH-alkyls in ethanol sets the stage for their integration as stabilizers in ethanol or other organic solvents.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMulticomponent perovskite oxides are an essential class of inorganic materials with diverse applications, where the ordering of cations can profoundly influence their physical and chemical properties. Unfortunately, the discovery and optimization of such oxides have been significantly hindered by their compositional and structural complexity. State-of-the-art brute-force experimental or computational methods can hardly resolve such complexity efficiently. Even one multicomponent oxide composition can have tens to hundreds of cation orderings, which are too expensive for brute-force high-throughput screening.To boost the high-throughput screening of multicomponent perovskite oxides, graph neural network models can be used to effectively predict material properties from the connections of atoms in crystal structures, allowing efficient computational discovery over a vast search space. However, while these models have been demonstrated to capture the compositional dependence of material properties across a broad chemical space, it is unclear whether such models can also effectively learn the ordering dependence of similar properties for a given composition. In addition, structures after costly density functional theory (DFT) relaxations have been dominantly used for training and leveraging such graph neural network models, which cannot truly eliminate the prohibitive cost of DFT in high-throughput screening.In this work, we developed graph neural network models to accurately predict key cation ordering−dependent properties of multicomponent perovskite oxides from DFT-unrelaxed cubic perovskite structures. Essentially, models that infer material properties by indirectly learning the thermodynamics of mixing lead to lower errors than those that predict these properties directly. Moreover, equivariant neural networks [1,2] better capture the ordering dependence of such properties than their symmetry-invariant counterparts [3] due to their higher expressivity in distinguishing the difference between the coordination environments and symmetries of various orderings. Lastly, using contrastive losses in the training of these models further increases the prediction accuracy by facilitating an optimal balance between capturing both the compositional and structural dependence of material properties. Overall, this work highlights an effective strategy for designing machine learning models with optimized robustness and generalizability for discovering multicomponent materials.References:[1] Geiger, et al. arXiv:2207.09453 (2022).[2] Schütt, et al. arXiv:2102.03150 (2021).[3] Xie, et al.Phys.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe design of ion selective materials with improved separations efficacy and efficiency is critical for the development of novel membrane technologies in water purification and desalination. In material classes such as polymeric membranes, MOFs, 2D nanosheets, and carbon nanotubes, pore geometry and chemistry are highly tunable, for example through chemical functionalization. In this study, we utilize a data-driven approach to investigate the design knobs of material structure and chemistry which can enhance ion selectivity. We curate a dataset of 1022 alkali metal coordinating molecular complexes from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and obtain ion binding energies from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our analysis reveals that energetic preferences correlate strongly with ion size and are largely due to enthalpic interactions rather than structural rearrangement. We then use machine learning models to identify significant features in ion coordination, such as coordination distances, electrostatic potential, and charge, that can discriminate between alkali ion species. These physical insights offer guidance toward the design of optimal membranes for ion selectivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe domain of π-conjugated polymer semiconductors is undoubtedly an active frontier for next-generation materials and a keen area of interest for both the materials informatics and organic electronics communities, due to their imminent promise in large-area, printable, deformable devices and mobilizing new energy applications. However, despite recent successes in the data-enabled development of organic transistors, photovoltaics, and electrochromic devices, rational design for organic thin-film electronics, particularly those that are polymer-based, still largely materialize through one-parameter-at-a-time, hypothesis-driven studies due to a lack of available representative experimental data. The materials domain of π-conjugated polymer semiconductors remains a research area in dire need of experimental data management solutions. However, experimental database management for polymer-based electronics is not trivial, especially when a plurality of the relevant attributes related to the provenance of the sample must be included accurately to form a robust, “reusable” data record. Fully capturing this information is not easy for organic devices. Because they are designed with critical device geometries at the nano- to micrometer length scale, their performance metrics are highly sensitive to their process history. Capturing this complex set of information requires the availability of domain standards and flexible data structures to account for the evolving process space that is inherently dynamic in experimental research. In this work, using organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) as a model system, a data model toward representation of organic device experiments is proposed, designed, and implemented in an object-relational database. To guide a robust representation of device process history, this work draws upon ISA-88, an international standard for automation in batch process control, to construct generalizable relationships across process transformations within the OFET fabrication procedure. By building a data repository that can handle the various nuances of the complex OFET design space, we present a foundation toward a suitable data-enabled platform to enhance hypothesis design, scientific decision-making, and model development within the traditionally “small data” space of the organic electronics community. Additionally, by designing a data model around an accepted process standard and defining keywords centered around the experimental procedure, this work not only enables a database design toward Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data representations for organic thin-film transistors, but also presents an adaptable prototype for both the organic electronics and the broader materials community.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPairwise similarity between macromolecules plays a significant role in numerous cheminformatics tasks such as ranking, clustering, and classification. Previous approaches for macromolecular similarity calculations involve generating chemistry-informed graph representations of macromolecules with nodes representing monomers and edges representing bonds. Subsequently, similarity scores are computed via graph edit distance or graph kernel methods. However, these approaches have significant limitations. Graph edit distance, which measures the minimum operation costs to transform one graph to another graph, is a nondeterministic polynomial (NP) complete problem. This limitation hinders the use of graph edit distance in time-sensitive applications, such as the real-time ranking of search results. Conversely, graph kernels transform graphs to fixed-length feature vectors and then compute an inner product of the feature vectors, yielding a pairwise similarity score. Without the need to do feature extractions, graph kernel methods offer improved efficiency, but they suffer from reduced accuracy and interpretability compared to graph edit distance.In this study, we propose a graph neural network model to address these challenges and accelerate macromolecular similarity calculations. The first step involves creating a database of macromolecule similarity by calculating and collecting the exact graph edit distances. The graph neural network model then proceeds through four stages: (1) node-level embedding, transforming each node of a graph into a vector by extracting the nodes' feature and structural properties; (2) graph-level embedding, generating one embedding vector for each graph by aggregating node embeddings; (3) graph-graph interactions using both the neural tensor network and the pairwise node comparison; and (4) fully connected network layers for graph edit distance predictions. The graph neural network is trained using the macromolecule pairwise graph edit distance database. Our proposed graph neural network model overcomes the limitations of previous graph similarity calculation methods. It substantially reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy and offers an efficient and precise solution for calculating the pairwise similarity of macromolecules. This novel method represents a significant advancement in cheminformatics for macromolecules, paving the way for the development of advanced search engines and quantitative design tools in macromolecules.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDue to the subtle balance of intermolecular interactions that govern structure–property relations, predicting the stability of crystal structures formed from molecular building blocks is a highly non-trivial scientific problem. A particularly active and fruitful approach involves classifying the different combinations of interacting chemical moieties, as understanding the relative energetics of different interactions enables the design of molecular crystals and fine-tuning of their stabilities. While this is usually performed based on the empirical observation of the most commonly encountered motifs in known crystal structures, we propose to apply a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine-learning techniques to automate the construction of an extensive library of molecular building blocks. We introduce a structural descriptor tailored to the prediction of the binding (lattice) energy and apply it to a curated dataset of organic crystals, exploiting its atom-centered nature to obtain a data-driven assessment of the contribution of different chemical groups to the lattice energy of the crystal. We then interpret this library using a low-dimensional representation of the structure–energy landscape and discuss selected examples of the insights into crystal engineering that can be extracted from this analysis, providing a complete database to guide the design of molecular materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCoarse-grained molecular models of proteins permit access to length and time scales unattainable by all-atom models and enable the simulation of important processes that occur on long time scales such as aggregation and folding. The reduced resolution of the coarse-grained models enables realization of computational accelerations, but sacrifices the atomistic resolution that can be vital for a complete understanding of the mechanistic details. Backmapping is the process of restoring the all-atom details to coarse-grained molecular representations in order to recover atomistic-level insight. Conventional backmapping approaches generate initial all-atom structures based on geometric rules and then apply energy relaxation to eliminate aphysical high-energy overlaps and produce stable all-atom configurations. The need for energy minimization makes these procedures typically quite expensive and slow. Recently, data-driven approaches have demonstrated great promise in furnishing trainable models to efficiently perform backmapping of small molecules and proteins. In this work, we report a novel backmapping approach based on autoregressive denoising diffusion probability models to restore all-atom details to coarse-grained simulations represented only by C-alpha coordinates. The generation process is conditioned on the coarse-grained protein configuration and any previously backmapped side chains in an autoregressive fashion in order to avoid steric clashes. As an inherently transferable and local model, it is scalable to proteins of arbitrary size with linear scaling. We train the model on over 100K proteins in the SidechainNet training data set and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on systems including DE Shaw training trajectories of fast-folding mini-proteins, ensembles of intrinsically-disordered proteins, and randomly sampled selections from the Protein Data Bank. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the transferable model on a given system can further improve performance in recapitulating protein-specific sidechain distributions. We make the backmapping tool available as a free, open source Python package.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSigma profiles, a type of molecular descriptor obtained through quantum chemistry calculations, have shown great performance when used as a feature for machine learning models. However, because the computation of sigma profiles involves DFT optimizations, often for reasonably large molecules, they are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Furthermore, there are no free, open-source tools readily available to directly calculate them. As such, the development of predictive methodologies able to estimate sigma profiles without the use of quantum-chemistry-based calculations would greatly enhance the applicability of these molecular descriptors in large scale machine learning models.Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a class of machine learning models that have a similar architecture to convolutional neural networks but operate on graphs. Graphs are a mathematical construction of nodes and edges, and are represented by adjacency matrices, a table indicating the connectivity between nodes. There is an obvious resemblance between the mathematical concept of a graph and molecular structures, with atoms and bonds being represented by nodes and edges, respectively. Thus, because molecules are easily translated to graphs without the need to compute quantum-chemistry-based descriptors, GCNs are the ideal candidate to accelerate the development and collection of vast sigma profile datasets.A well-known issue of GCNs pertains to the accurate description of the global and local environment of atoms in molecules, which often requires many convolution iterations, leading to over-smoothing and poor model performance. For example, the chemical natures of aromatic and aliphatic carbons are markedly distinct, but several iterations would be necessary for a GCN to learn a proper graph embedding of a ring with six nodes (e.g., benzene ring). Fortunately, these issues have been addressed at length by the molecular mechanics community. That is, commonplace to the development of classical force fields is the necessity of distinguishing the polarity and behavior of atoms with different neighboring environments. Thus, force fields typically assign class types (i.e., numerical values) to distinguish between atoms with the same atomic number but different neighboring moieties. The existence of this type of atom classification, developed throughout decades of trial-and-error methodologies and heuristics, may prove to be an excellent type of node-level featurization to be used in GNNs and, thus, merits its investigation.Motivated by the need to expedite the development of large sigma profile datasets, the objective of this work is to ascertain the usefulness of force field atom types as node-level features in GNN models. To do so, graph representations were constructed for the compounds present in a freely available sigma profile database, with three types of node-level features being explored: simple atomic numbers, general Amber force field (GAFF) atom types, and Merck molecular force field (MMFF) atom types. GAFF and MMFF were chosen due to the breadth of molecules that both force fields can simultaneously describe, as well as the availability of tools that perform their atom typing automatically. Combining these node-level features with GCNs led to models with excellent sigma profile predictive capability (coefficients of determination larger than 0.95), with both force fields displaying similar performances. Finally, to demonstrate their practical applicability, the sigma profiles predicted using this methodology were used as the input to machine learning models previously developed in the literature to estimate the boiling temperature and aqueous solubility of organic compounds, yielding performances that rival those attained using sigma profiles obtained through quantum chemistry calculations.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSoft gels have many mechanisms for formation, including phase separation, hierarchical aggregation, and self-assembly of soft matter materials (e.g., polymers, colloids) [1,2]. The stochastic and multi-scale nature of these mechanisms causes soft gels to have hierarchical structure. This structure imbues soft gels with physical properties, such as texture, elasticity, and stability [1,2,3]. These diverse mechanical properties can be optimized for a broad range of industrial applications such as cosmetics, building materials, and pharmaceuticals [4,5,6].A major bottleneck in the design and application of soft gel materials is the lack of fundamental understanding of the link between the gel’s microstructural topology and geometry and their physical characteristics [1,2]. This is difficult to understand due to the multiple phenomena observed in soft gels such as stiffening, aging, and yielding that occur across time and length scales within the gel [3,7]. These phenomena are described by dynamic changes in both topology (bonding network) and geometry (spatial distribution) of the material [7]. Furthermore, many of the methods used in understanding these phenomena focus exclusively on either the geometry or topology of soft gels which does not provide a wholistic characterization.In this presentation, we use the Euler characteristic to quantify both the geometry and topology of soft gel molecular simulations [1]. The Euler characteristic (EC) is a simple, interpretable descriptor of the shape of data [8,9]. The EC captures and quantifies the topological invariants of a shape, such as the number of connected components, cycles, and voids. Furthermore, these topological invariants are directly related to the geometry of the gel, allowing us to capture both topology and geometry simultaneously. We couple our EC analysis with a filtration, a method developed in the field of Topological Data Analysis, which we use to quantify the shape of our soft gel simulations at multiple scales [8,9]. This technique also allows us to bypass the need for parameter selection, improving the robustness of our analysis in comparison to other parametric methods.We leverage the EC to capture and differentiate the topological and geometrical changes of soft gels undergoing shear stress. The computation of the EC is easily scaled to large simulated systems, allowing us to analyze hundreds of simulation snapshots with tens of thousands of molecules in minutes using common computational hardware. Through the EC, we identify significant phase changes in gel multi-scale topology/geometry as the gel is stiffened and when the gel undergoes yielding. These results provide insight into the multi-scale mechanisms associated with nonlinear responses of gels, which are important for understanding and designing the dynamic behavior of gels to optimize hardening, stiffening, or self-healing [3]. We also explore the physical connections between the observed topological/geometric phase transitions and the characteristics of the resulting soft gel.References:[1] Colombo, Jader, and Emanuela Del Gado. \"Stress localization, stiffening, and yielding in a model colloidal gel.\" Journal of rheology 58.5 (2014): 1089-1116.[2] Bouzid, Mehdi, and Emanuela Del Gado. \"Network topology in soft gels: Hardening and softening materials.\" Langmuir 34.3 (2018): 773-781.[3] Bouzid, Mehdi, and Emanuela Del Gado. \"Mechanics of soft gels: Linear and nonlinear response.\" Handbook of Materials Modeling: Applications: Current and Emerging Materials (2020): 1719-1746.[4] Burey, Paulomi, et al. \"Hydrocolloid gel particles: formation, characterization, and application.\" Critical reviews in food science and nutrition 48.5 (2008): 361-377.[5] Gallegos, C., and J.

Recent developments in machine learning provide a promising avenue for better order parameters in complex systems that are challenging to study using traditional approaches. However, the application of machine learning to self-assembly on shape particles is still underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that involves training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a local environment classifier for shape particles, using input features such as particle distances and orientations. Our MLP model is trained in a supervised manner with shape symmetry-encoded data augmentation technique, without the need for any traditional order parameters or symmetry functions. We evaluate the performance of our model on four different scenarios involving self-assembly of cubic structures, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional patchy shape particle systems, hexagonal bipyramids with varying aspect ratios, and truncated shapes with different degrees of truncation. The proposed training process and data augmentation technique are both straightforward and highly interpretable, enabling easy application of the model to other processes involving particle orientations. Our work thus presents a valuable tool for the investigation of self-assembly processes on shape particles, with potential applications in structure identification of molecular or coarse-grained systems.",

Furthermore, automation of workflows allows for easier setup of high-throughput screening processes, by integrating with workflow management tools such as signac and signac-flow.[3]MoSDeF has been successfully applied to facilitate simulation studies in conjunction with several open source simulation codes. From the beginning, the MoSDeF project has provided support for molecular dynamics simulation engines, such as GROMACS and LAMMPS.[4, 5] As part of the continued community development of MoSDeF support has now been extended to GOMC (via the MoSDeF-GOMC library), Cassandra (via the MoSDeF-Cassandra library), and HOOMD-blue.[6-8]These integrations enable more automated, intuitive, and reproducible ways to set up simulations with these engines. MoSDeF can be used to easily build individual systems for new users and complex/integrated reproducible workflows for experts. This enables these workflows to be used in teaching new users and running training workshops without the usual overhead associated with learning inputs to complex codes. We will continue working to further integrate MoSDeF with other tools/simulation engines existing in the community, joining forces with similar efforts, such as the FAIR consortium and OpenKIM, to effectively address the reproducibility issue of the field.[9, 10]References“MoSDeF” [Online].

    "abstract": "AbstractWhen developing new methods for molecular simulation, eliminating bugs can be challenging. Programming languages like Python, FORTRAN, and Julia flag syntax errors, but don't (and cannot) catch errors in math or program logic - these must be rooted out by human experts. These issues can be managed by following best practices in software development (such as writing tests alongside the program), but even these do not guarantee that code is correct.Lean is a new programming language developed for writing and automatically checking the logic of math proofs. We show how Lean can be used to write programs in scientific computing, and report on our progress toward writing a molecular dynamics simulation engine, and proving its correctness, in Lean.",

    "abstract": "AbstractData is beginning to play a greater role in transforming the chemical engineering research and practice. The size of chemistry databases, their complexity, and their number have increased continuously over time. One of the most comprehensive general public database is PubChem. It hosts information on more than 60 million unique chemical structures and it serves as a key chemical information resource for researchers in many biomedical science areas, including cheminformatics, chemical biology, and medicinal chemistry. PubChem provides various tools that fulfil criteria for simple and effective searching. However, these tools are insufficient if the search needs to be designed to fulfil complex criteria as well as if new information needs to be derived from existing data.Since the landmark publication by Berners-Lee et al., the semantic web field has envisioned the next generation of the web in both a human- and machine-readable format and in recent years it is emerging as an increasingly important approach for better scientific data sharing and faster data processing using computers.The World Avatar (TWA) project uses the semantic web technologies to create a digital ’avatar’ of the real world. The digital world is composed of a dynamic knowledge graph that contains concepts and data that describe the world, and an ecosystem of autonomous computational agents that simulate the behaviour of the world and that continuously update the concepts and data. A knowledge graph (KG) is a network of data expressed as a directed graph, where the nodes of the graph are concepts or their instances (data items) and the edges of the graph are links between related concepts or instances. This provides a powerful means to host, query and traverse data, and to find and retrieve related information. The autonomous computational agents are the key aspect of the dynamic nature of the KG. They continuously and independently act on the KG performing various tasks with the aim of producing a self-growing, self-updating, and self-improving ecosystem.To create a digital representation of the world that bridges the molecular-scale chemistry level to real world macroscale phenomena and enables cross-domain applications, it is crucial to have a rich general chemistry domain. Exposing the PubChem data to semantic web services may help in this regard. Due to the difficulties on dealing with data from different sources and mostly collected in the form of strings, the current databases that translate data from PubChem in relational databases do not include all the available information that can be accessed in the web. Properties like boiling point, melting point, density or solubility as well as spectral information on chemical species are currently not available in any relational database.The purpose of this work was to develop an ontology, OntoSpecies, that describes chemical species and their properties and that aims to serve as core of the chemistry domain of TWA KG and at the same time address some of the limitations of previous chemistry relational databases. Specifically, the resulting ontology:- Provides knowledge on general chemistry concepts related to chemical species through the integration of PubChem data on compounds into the database using a software agents. Concepts that are currently not exported in any relational database are also included in the ontology.- Gives access to the dataset through a SPARQL endpoint. This will remove the inherent limitations of using the web-based PubChem resource (such as inability to construct complicated queries using the available web-based interfaces) by allowing a researcher to use readily available semantic technologies to query and analyze PubChem data on local computing resources.- Uses a dynamic knowledge-graph-based approach to have a self-growing database that not only integrates data from different sources but also creates and infers knowledge through the uses of software agents.It is anticipated that our approach will play a key role in the next generation of chemical informatics. The ontological format permits advanced queries, and easy data analysis and visualization. This can be used to compare chemical properties of similar compounds, find compounds with required characteristics as well as automate laborious data gathering from researcher. We show how tasks like the identification of species in unknown mixture based on NMR spectrum, the selection of suitable solvents based on multiple criteria or the investigation of trends in chemical properties can be addressed using SPARQL queries in combination with the use of software agents to postprocess the information obtained as query result. We also show how the ontological format is beneficial to maintain and enrich the data set, as well as to check the consistency and accuracy of the data. Finally, the link between OntoSpecies and other ontologies in TWA is discussed in the context of laboratory automation and cross-domain applications in TWA ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe MolMod force field database [1] is presented. The MolMod database is an open-access web-based database for classical force fields for fluids that can be used in molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations for modeling a large variety of thermodynamic properties as well as for the simulation of nanoscopic processes. The MolMod database contains both component-specific force fields and transferable force fields. In a component-specific force field, the model parameters of a given force field are only valid for a certain component. A transferable force field, on the other hand, is a chemical construction plan specifying intermolecular and intramolecular interactions between different types of atoms or different chemical groups and can be used for building a force field model for a given component. The vast majority of force fields in the database was parametrized using vapor-liquid equilibrium data and accordingly describe such data well. In many cases, also predictions of other properties, like transport and interfacial properties, were tested and found to be in good agreement with experimental data. Many of the molecular models were also successfully tested for modeling mixtures using combination rules like those of Lorentz and Berthelot.The MolMod database presently comprises approximately 700 component-specific force fields – and is constantly growing. This includes mostly molecular substances and also some ionic components. The database comprises both rigid force fields as well as flexible force fields with internal degrees of freedom. Moreover, the MolMod database comprises eight transferable force field that can be used for describing a large number of components. Force field developers are invited so submit their models to the MolMod admins for being included in the database.For transferable force fields, the MolMod database contains a graphical user interface in the front-end of the website that enables the user to construct essentially any organic molecule. Moreover, the user can specify, which transferable force field is to be used, e.g. TraPPE or OPLS. Then, the website provides the actual force field parameters for the chosen molecule (cf. Fig. 1).For implementing transferable force fields in the MolMod database, a new SQL-based data scheme was developed, which provides a machine-readable format for integrating a given transferable force field. This force field scheme is generalized such that different transferable force fields can be formulated within the data scheme. The data scheme can be applied to all-atom as well as united-atom transferable force fields. Using this data scheme, multiple popular transferable force fields are implemented in the database, e.g. the TraPPE, OPLS-AA, and Potoff force field.The MolMod database provides a large variety of search functionalities. For all force fields, the references to the original literature are given. The force fields are presented in a consistent unit system containing the full specifications of the molecular model. Moreover, the MolMod database provides ready-to-use input files for different simulation engines, e.g. LAMMPS [2], GROMACS [3], ms2 [4], and ls1 mardyn [5] etc. Since these molecular simulation codes are based on different approaches to realize for example multipole interactions, the geometry definition, and the rigidity of molecules, on the fly conversion routines are implemented in the database kernel. This enables researchers to include the molecular models easily in their individual work flows for predicting thermodynamic properties of fluids.References:[1] S. Stephan et al.: Mol.

    "abstract": "AbstractType labels are alphanumeric strings assigned to atoms, bonds, angles, etc. to supplement the numeric types that are traditionally used in LAMMPS. The introduction of type labels into LAMMPS helps to streamline several types of common tasks and workflows, and opens up many possibilities for new features. For example, atom types could be assigned labels that match the conventions of a given force field, which means LAMMPS atom types are human readable and compatible with tools that follow the same conventions. Input files are more universal when they use type labels rather than assign arbitrary numbers to interaction types for each simulation. The increased portability of topology files greatly simplifies the task of setting up simulations that require multiple data files or molecule template files. Workflows involving LAMMPS features that require creating multiple files or manipulating interaction types, such as the REACTER protocol, are considerably streamlined once adapted to take advantage of type labels. Type labels enable advanced capabilities within the REACTER protocol, including the automatic assignment of types for new bonded interactions created during reactions. The type labels framework also allows bonded force fields to be supported within the OpenKIM repository. The developers look forward to working with the community so that more molecular modeling tools can take advantage of the type labels framework.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMolecular simulations are increasingly used to accurately predict the properties of novel materials and understand molecular based phenomena beyond the level of current imaging techniques. Because of this, a wide array of techniques, methods, and software has been published and distributed to the scientific community. Specifically, several molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) molecular simulation codes have been made open-source and community developed in order to reduce the workload, overhead, and potential errors with in-house computational codes. Recently, Schappals et al. published work on the comparison of results for density calculations from different force fields with varying groups performing the same calculations using different simulation engines[1]. They found reasonable reproducibility, with a standard deviation of the relative errors (STD-RE) of 0.95%, but the results did not fall within statistical agreement across the engines they studied. They concluded that these systematic errors are inherent to molecular simulations once a certain degree of complexity is reached and stem from a combination of code implementation, software, and human errors. d is a software package designed to standardize inputs to different simulation software, and has the benefits of implementing models in a standardized, well tested, and scriptable way, following the principles of TRUEsimulations[2,3]. This work shows that using MoSDeF to initialize a workflow results in consistent engine differences (STD-RE 0.099%) for even more complex arrays of models and methods. Comparing the bias as synonymously as possible to the methods employed by Schappals et. al., MoSDeF gives a 9.7-fold decrease in relative error on a per simulation basis, and a 43-fold decrease in error using best practices replicate averaging. Additionally, the reduction in systematic errors in the model implementation allows us to explore the contributions of other errors from more subtle sources, such as the effect of flexible vs rigid bonds (0.2%-0.8%), the effect of different long range correction treatment (1.2-3.5%), and the effect of slightly altered SPC/E forcefield parameters (0.05%).ReferencesSchappals, M.; Mecklenfeld, A.; Kröger, L.; Botan, V.; Köster, A.; Stephan, S.;Garćıa, E.

    "abstract": "AbstractMolecular structure identification is a fundamental task in chemistry that enables various niche applications such as degradant analysis, property prediction and formulation development. Spectroscopic methods, including mass spectrometry (MS), infrared (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, are widely used to identify unknown products. However, due to the complexity of potential molecular structure space, the information obtained from spectroscopic characterization is often deficient, leaving the problem of elucidating chemical structure from spectral results underdetermined. To address this challenge, we propose a machine learning (ML) model that integrates spectral outcomes with information on starting materials, and establishes a deductive workflow for structure prediction. Our approach leverages the fact that researchers usually have information on what they put in the flasks prior to analyzing the unknown spectroscopic data. This additional information of reactants and reagents restricts the vastness of product space, leading to more precise structure prediction over analyzing spectra from scratch. The deductive ML model comprises several parallel-placed transformer modules which study the structural features of reactants, as well as the spectral fingerprint patterns. A deductive super-network then comprehensively deduces the most likely molecular candidates. It is typical that the success of ML approach depends on the quality and completeness of the data used to train the model. However, our model has the advantage of maintaining comparable performance even when one or more spectroscopes are absent.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIntegrins are transmembrane proteins that play a critical role in cell adhesion and cell signaling.[1,2] Upon activation, integrins undergo a large-scale conformational transition from a bent to an extended state. Impaired conformational transitions of integrin are linked to various diseases such as bleeding disorders, immunodeficiency, and cancer.[3] To this end, understanding integrin activation is of fundamental interest and is critical to the development of therapeutics targeting integrin.[1-5]While crystal structures of bent conformations of different integrins are well-characterized, only fractions of extended conformations are available. Additionally, there is a limited understanding of intermediate conformations of integrin using experimental methods because of their transient nature. Alternatively, studying integrin activation using conventional molecular dynamics simulations require inordinate computational resources because integrins are large heterodimer proteins comprising ~1770 residues. Our goal is to address this problem in characterizing unknown intermediate conformations of integrin by combining generative adversarial networks (GAN)[6] and targeted molecular dynamics simulations.We demonstrate our approach by training GAN using coarse-grained representations of ɑIIbβ3integrin in an active, two partially inactive and an inactivate state, which are sampled via unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.[4] We utilize adaptive diffusion maps[7] to learn the latent space of the integrin. Targeted molecular dynamics simulations are employed to predict the all-atom conformations from the coarse-grained transition state structures generated by GAN. Thereby, allowing access to previously unknown all-atom conformations along the activation pathway of integrin. In our talk, we will present our approach and the predicted all-atom conformations of ɑIIbβ3integrin in the transition region and discuss their biophysical validity and significance.References[1] Bidone TC, Polley A, Jin J, Driscoll T, Iwamoto DV, Calderwood DA, Schwartz MA, Voth GA.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe in-vitro experiments studying RNA folding have reported the presence of non-native low-free energy structures in the folding pathways1.One bottleneck in using conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in sampling the folding landscapes is that the simulation tends to get stuck in metastable states, as the non-native structures have free energies similar to the folded native structure. To address this, advanced sampling methods can be employed to accelerate the simulation. Many of those methods require defining a set of reaction coordinates or collective variables (CV) i.e. low-dimensional variables that can be used to differentiate between the different metastable states visited by the simulation. Moreover, the success of the sampling often depends on the quality of CVs (i.e. their ability to capture the slowest modes of the process). Obtaining such high quality CVs, however, is a cumbersome task. Neural networks are widely being used to obtain a non-linear set of CVs that can capture the slowest modes of a process. But the current approaches require the availability of a training data set from a reference biased or unbiased simulation to determine the CVs. To circumvent this requirement, we have adapted a deep learning-driven adaptive MD simulation package, called DeepDrive MD that finds undersampled states from an ensemble of running simulations and guides new simulations to visit the unexplored regions of the phase space. For this, we use a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to represent the visited states in a low-dimensional latent space2. Outliers from this learned latent space are identified and treated as starting points for new simulations, resulting in the exploration of newer regions of the phase space. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in simulating the folding pathways of a very simple RNA tetraloop GGCGAGAGCC. Our results show that the CVAE is able to learn the slowest degrees of freedom involved in the folding process and successfully samples the transition pathways from the unfolded to the folded state.References:1.

    "abstract": "AbstractNon-ionic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as designer solvents for applications such as catalysis, extraction, and carbon capture and conversion. A major challenge is the lack of an efficient tool to discover DES candidates. Currently, the search relies heavily on the researchers intuition or a trial-and-error process, which leads to a low success rate or bypassing of promising candidates. Recognizing the central role that hydrogen bonds play in the DES formation, this work aims to decipher the hydrogen bond features for DESs and develop machine learning models to predict the potential of a system to be DES based on the hydrogen bond-based descriptors. We first analyze the hydrogen bond properties of 38 known DES and 111 known non-DES systems using their molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. The analysis reveals two features for DES compared to non-DES: (a) the imbalance between the numbers of the two intra-component hydrogen bonds, and (b) more and stronger inter-component hydrogen bonds. Based on the analysis results, we developed 30 machine learning models using ten algorithms and three types of hydrogen bond-based descriptors. The model performance is first benchmarked using their average and minimal ROC-AUC values. We also analyze the importance of individual features in the models and the results are consistent with the simulation-based statistical analysis. Finally, we validate the prediction ability of the models using the experimental results of 34 systems. The Extra Trees outperforms the others in the validation with an ROC-AUC of 0.88. Our work iterates the importance of hydrogen bond in DES formation and shows the potential of machine learning in discovering new DESs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConjugated polymer semiconductors are promising materials for their imminent potential in enabling stretchable, flexible, and deformable device applications, such as in transistors, photovoltaics, and others. Recently, polymer semiconductor/insulator blends have gained popularity as a formulation method to afford mechanical properties without sacrificing device performance. For example, when insulating polymers are blended with the active semiconducting layer of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), the charge-carrier mobility (the main device metric) can match or even exceed devices made with only the single semiconducting component, even at very low compositions of the semiconductor. Crucial to understanding this behavior is interrogating the interplay between solution processing parameters, the thin-film morphology, structural measurements, and device metrics within a rich process-structure-property space that can be time-consuming to measure. Unfortunately, capturing the exact location of behavior onsets, phase boundaries, and other transitions associated with improved performance can be challenging as they take place at very sensitive windows. The number of experiments required to fully understand the process-structure-property relationships quickly multiplies when subsequently exploring this composition-performance trend with respect to different polymers/solvents, or incorporating solution processing steps (e.g., UV-irradiation, aging, etc.). In this work, to aid in traversing the rich compositional landscape of polymer semiconductor/insulator blends, we incorporate a gradient film methodology through an automated flow system as a means of high-throughput experimentation. The screening of the P3HT/PS and DPP-DTT/PS composition libraries presented herein represents how the gradient film approach can facilitate preliminary exploration of process-structure-property relationships in polymer thin-film systems. The large amount of data generated from the gradient film libraries can then be integrated with data science techniques (e.g. machine learning) to model the relationship between polymer composition and OFET device performance. By leveraging the techniques reported herein, we envision the high throughput experimental screening approach to be broadly applicable to other solution-based thin-film systems, including organic device applications and beyond.",

While these methods provide excellent sensitivity and selectivity, they often require complex sample preparation procedures, costly laboratory infrastructure, and highly trained personnel.To address these limitations, new approaches have been developed in recent studies, including many optical, electrochemical, and mechanical-based techniques [4, 7]. Among these new approaches, aqueous emulsions of thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) [8-13] have gained growing attention because they can exhibit distinctive optical responses in the presence of surfactants. When coupled with machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), LC-in-water emulsions have emerged as sensitive, rapid, and inexpensive sensors or reporters of environmental amphiphiles [14-18]. However, many existing CNN-based LC sensing methods require the use of expensive instrumentation (e.g., flow cytometry [14]) or computational resources (e.g., videos [18]) for quantitative characterization, owing to variations in optical responses among individual LC droplets with different sizes in an LC-in-water emulsion.Here, we report an LC-based surfactant sensing platform that takes a step toward addressing several of the abovementioned issues and can predict concentrations and types of model surfactants in aqueous solutions. Our approach uses microcontact-printed arrays of micrometer-scale droplets of thermotropic LCs and hierarchical CNNs to automatically extract and decode rich information about topological defects and color patterns available in optical micrographs of LC droplets to classify and quantify adsorbed surfactants. The microcontact-printed LC droplets are surface-immobilized and uniformly sized, reducing variations in optical responses. The proposed hierarchical CNN contains two levels of 2D CNNs that are trained on different data representations. The selection of the data representation for each level relies on the detection focus. The first level is intended to differentiate defect patterns, and therefore grayscale images, which highlight the contrast between light and shade and contain sufficient information for defect pattern classification. The second level, on the other hand, is forced to learn patterns that are less distinguishable and thus require color information (e.g., RGB). Overall, we show that the combination of microcontact-printed LC arrays and machine learning provides a convenient and robust platform that could prove useful for developing high-throughput sensors for on-site testing of environmentally or biologically relevant amphiphiles.References[1] Rosen, M.

The crucial issue is how to rapidly predict the gas adsorption capacity of MOF adsorbents, however, time-consuming synthesis and adsorption experiments as well as expensive simulations are not preferred. Therefore, we build a universal material learning framework based on transformer for MOFs (Uni-MOF). This pre-trained representation learning framework extracts structural information from hundreds of thousands of 3D materials with no labels, which enables precise prediction of gas adsorption amount based on small data sets and cross-system prediction scenarios. This pre-trained model is also versatile for screening MOF materials under different application criteria.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMicroscopy-based characterization techniques for nanomaterials are increasingly accurate and accessible to researchers. In order to determine structure/property relations, quantitative methods are needed to interpret microscopy images, and this is especially challenging for structured materials. For example, surface self-assembly processes produce microscopy images with complex spatially varying patterns that include large numbers of defects, both orientational and translational. Recent advancements in quantitative characterization of (nano)structured surfaces have enabled automated analysis of microscopy images. These methods include the use of local bond orientational order parameters and polar shapelets, focused on identification, classification, and quantification of local order. However, to date, there has been less focus on classification of defects in local order.Defects in nanomaterials, including both translational (dislocations) and orientational (disclination) types, are topologically equivalent to those observed in crystalline phases. However, in soft materials the local structure of defects can vary substantially for equivalent topological charge. This is due to ordered phases in soft materials typically resulting from self-assembly of many constituent molecules, which allows for significant variation in local pattern length scale and the presence of local disorder within extreme pattern deformation.Furthermore, the use of defects to manipulate and improve material performance has become increasingly recognized as an important aspect of material design, sometimes referred to as defect structure engineering. Therefore, the development of computational resources to both identify and classify these defects is imperative for quantification of local (nano)structure/property order.In this work, a previously developed shapelet-based method for quantification of surface order is used to develop an unsupervised defect identification and classification method that is computationally more efficient than previous work. The previously developed shapelet-based method requires user input; specifically, the identification of a local pattern of interest within the target microscopy image. The presented method uses local pattern orientation with respect to a selected shapelet basis set in conjunction with a clustering scheme to automatically identify both translational and orientational defect structures without requiring information from the user; it also produces a defect identification output containing less noise and response variation compared to previous work. Identified defect structures are then classified based on shapelet response vectors, similar to the previously developed method, in order to classify them based on local pattern structure.The defect identification and classification method is applied to a range of representative ordered surfaces resulting from self-assembly including stripe and hexagonal structures. Imaging from simulations and experimentation of surface self-assembly are analyzed using the presented method and compared to identification/classification conducted manually. The method is able to successfully identify and classify orientational and translational defects on a variety of structural patterns, depending on the resolution and noise present in the input microscopy image.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe pair correlation function (PCF) is an important feature to study the structure of materials at the atomic or molecular level. It provides information about the probability of finding two particles at a certain distance from each other, and can be used to characterize the spatial arrangement of particles in a material. Soft materials, such as polymers, colloids, and biomolecules, are characterized by their flexibility and deformability. Their PCFs typically show long-range correlations and broad peaks, reflecting their disordered and heterogeneous nature. Hard materials, such as crystals, semiconductors, and metals, are characterized by their rigidity and strong interatomic interactions. Their PCFs typically show sharp peaks and short-range correlations, reflecting their ordered and homogeneous nature. Molecular simulations have been routinely used to estimate the PCF of materials. However, they are computationally very expensive, and estimating PCFs for the entire compositional space of a material remains a substantially challenging task. Here, we propose a machine learning pipeline (ML) for rapid prediction of PCF of a material based on the information of its composition. We conduct ~ 100 molecular simulations for a given material and calculate its PCFs for varying composition. We use these PCFs and their corresponding composition information to build, test and validate the ML method. Within this ML pipeline, the grayscale images of PCF of a material are encoded to a latent space using a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder. Subsequently, a random forest regressor establishes a correlation between the composition of the material and the latent space representation of its PCF. This ML model is then used for predicting PCF for many unknown compositions of the material. We have successfully demonstrated the performance of our ML model for three representative cases – binary liquid mixtures, polymer nanocomposites and oxide glasses. This method is very generic and can accelerate the design, discovery, and fundamental understanding of composition-PCF relations of a wide range of soft and hard materials.",

In this study, we investigate the impact of the configurational sampling distribution on the accuracy of NNIPs for two molecular systems, butane and alanine dipeptide. Specifically, we examine scenarios where the range of the collective variables (CVs) required for free energy surface determination is not known a priori and investigate the effect of the training data distribution on the accuracy of NNIPs. To address this, we create representative datasets that mimic various distributions of configurations and use hyperparameter optimization to train the NNIP models while analyzing their dependence on system size and shape. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive testing procedure that evaluates energy/force predictions, molecular dynamics stability, structural properties, thermodynamic properties, and free energy surface determination using enhanced sampling techniques to validate the accuracy and stability of the models. Our study highlights the challenges associated with generating a training dataset with a sufficient representation of CVs for these molecular systems and provides a robust testing methodology for accurate free energy surface determination using NNIPs and enhanced sampling techniques when the required CV range is unknown.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWater is an important material relevant to biology, chemistry, and catalysis among others, however, the accurate simulation of water is challenging because it requires long molecular dynamics simulations to equilibrate the system due to the complex interactions between the molecules. The MB-Pol potential has been developed to reproduce CCSD(T) quality results, but at a lower cost than full quantum mechanical simulations and allows to reproduce the ground truth for physical properties (e.g. density, compressibility, radial distribution function, etc.) which are typically inaccessible using quantum mechanical calculations due to long equilibration times (10 – 100 ns). Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) serve as an alternative to accelerate atomistic simulations by learning the complex set of interactions from existing data. We show that the Allegro extension of NequIP can accurately learn from liquid, gas, and solid phases of H2O. The transferability of MLFF models trained on different phases is also explored to determine what information is crucial to the resulting MLFF. Importantly, we find that our MLFFs can describe physically meaningful many-body interactions that are not directly trained on and allow even faster simulations than MB-pol. In addition, MLFFs will be possible to combine with additional data to describe more complex systems than water only that are directly relevant to practical problems in biology, chemistry, and catalysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe effect of salinity, pressure, and different cushion gases like carbon dioxide and methane on the interfacial tension (IFT) between H2 and brine is essential in many applications like geological hydrogen storage. We have used molecular dynamics simulation to calculate the surface tension of H2-CH4/brine and H2-CO2/brine systems under varying pressures and salinities. In preparing the simulation box, the number of molecular units for the gas phase was calculated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state with simple van der Waals mixing rules. The simulation box (Lx = 4 nm, Ly = 4 nm, Lz = 12 nm) was built; energy minimization was carried out using the steepest decent algorithm until the maximum force was converged to 100 kJ/mol. Subsequently, 0.1 ns NVT equilibration and 50 ns production runs were performed. The cut-off distance for van der Waals interactions was set to 1.2 nm while electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald summation.The simulation trajectories were analyzed to construct density profiles and use the principal components of the pressure tensor in order to calculate the IFT. It was found that higher ionic strength resulted in greater surface tension which is a consequence of the perturbation of water structure brought about by the ions. Furthermore, the H2-CO2 mixture had a lower IFT compared to H2-CH4. The surface tension manifests due to the difference in net forces between molecules in the bulk liquid solution and those near the interface. Because the CO2 mixture interacts with the liquid more strongly, the surface tension will be less than that of the CH4 mixture. This was verified by calculating the interaction energies between the phases, and the resulting trend matched the IFT one.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCO2capture and geological sequestration have been considered important strategies to reduce the greenhouse gas effect. Meanwhile, H2produced from water using renewable energy and stored underground will be important components in a H2supply chain in a future H2-based economy. When injected into a reservoir, gas interacts with earth materials that might impact the safety and economic feasibility of a storage. In this talk, we will discuss gas intercalation into smectite that is present in caprock. Intercalation traps CO2, thus improving CO2storage integrity. However, intercalation causes H2loss. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we calculate free energy landscapes of gas intercalation into montmorillonite interlayers as a function of structural charge distributions and interlayer hydration states. Our results reveal that hydrated clay interlayers promote gas uptake into the hydrophobic (e.g., siloxane groups) domain, while inhibiting gas sorption near the hydrophilic sites (e.g., charge sites). On average, the CO2/water ratio in interlayers is higher than CO2/water ratio in bulk water. However, H2/water ratio in interlayers is comparable or less than H2/water ratio in bulk water. Compared to CO2, the amount of H2intercalated into hydrated interlayers is about one to two orders of magnitude smaller. Our results qualitatively predict that H2loss due to intercalation into clay-rich caprock and leak through clay interlayers, if any, is limited.Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPlastic pollution on the micrometer or nanometer scale, termed microplastics or nanoplastics (MNPs), is a pressing environmental issue. There are millions of tons of MNPs in just the top 200 meters of the Atlantic Ocean, and MNPs are also found in the arctic ice caps, the atmosphere, and many food and water sources. The ubiquitous presence of MNPs causes many organisms, including humans, to consume MNPs daily, which is believed to have negative health impacts. The environmental and health risks associated with MNPs have spurred much research into creating methods that detect and remove MNP pollution from the environment.We aim to computationally design plastic-binding peptides to help remediate MNP pollution. Specifically, we are working with collaborators to remediate MNP pollution in bodies of water by conjugating the designed peptides to active particle microcleaners to help capture MNPs, incorporating the peptides into liquid crystal sensors to create a platform for detecting and characterizing MNP waste, and expressing the peptides on the surface of engineered microbes to increase cell adhesion and subsequent degradation of MNPs.In this presentation, we will discuss our efforts to design peptides that bind to four of the most common plastics: polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and PET. Towards this goal, we first generated models of plastic surfaces via molecular dynamics simulations, then developed a score function that captures the key intermolecular interactions between the peptide and the plastic surface. Next, we developed a procedure that produces an ensemble of adsorbed conformations to sample the vast conformational space available to peptides in the adsorbed state. We then usePeptideBindingDesign (PepBD), a Monte Carlo algorithm paired with simulated annealing, to optimize the peptide sequence and structure for each starting conformation. The top-scoring peptides from the ensemble of starting states were tested using steered molecular dynamics simulations to obtain approximate adsorption free energies. The best peptides from simulations were tested experimentally through atomic force microscopy and biolayer interferometry. Our results indicate the peptides designed by PepBD have higher affinity for plastics than the peptides previously found using phage display. Lastly, we also investigate the properties that endow a peptide with high affinity for plastics, and how these properties vary for different plastic targets.",

In order to develop a better understanding of the fate of these molecules in aqueous systems, it is important to quantify the interaction of these molecules with different microplastic species. Here, we experimentally assess the adsorption behavior of PFOS in aqueous media onto the surfaces of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The experimental behavior is further analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the PFAS superficial properties, such as the PFAS-PFAS virial coefficient and transfer free energy, in which PFAS molecules with different alkyl sizes are evaluated. The adsorption mechanism of four different perfluorooctyl PFAS molecules on PE, PP, and PVC nanoplastic particles is evaluated by inspecting the potential-of-mean-force of pulling the PFAS molecules from the aqueous bulk phase to the plastic-water interfacial region. The molecular simulation results suggest a pronounced dispersive interaction between the polymer and PFAS molecules for PE and PP; while the dispersive interaction dominates the PVC systems, as compared to PE and PP, a much stronger coulombic PFAS-PVC interaction is found. Overall, evaluating the relevant molecular features involved in the adsorption of aqueous phase dispersed PFAS molecules, as performed in this work, is essential in understanding the lifecycle of PFAS transport and designing novel polymetric adsorbent materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractVisible-light-absorbing dyes adsorbed on broad-band gap oxide semiconductors such as titania have shown remarkable power conversion efficiencies when used as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The dye molecules oxidize upon illumination, transferring the electrons to the titania particles. A redox electrolyte, such as an acetonitrile solution of iodide and triiodide, is required to regenerate the oxidized dye and maintain continuity in the photovoltaic activity. DSSC-based photoelectrochemical cells are being explored to desalinate brackish water and produce potable water [1]. Applications such as these preclude the use of toxic and volatile solvents in the preparation of the redox electrolyte. Water is the preferred solvent. However, DSSCs show a significant performance loss when water is used instead of acetonitrile as the electrolyte solvent.This work used atomistic and molecular simulations of selected dyes (known to exhibit photovoltaic activity in experiments) to gain fundamental insights into the differences between the aqueous and organic electrolyte interfaces. Critical optical and electronic properties of the dyes were predicted using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Also, a molecular dynamics (MD) model was developed to study the behavior of the dye/titania interface in water and acetonitrile. Based on the DFT calculations, the absorption spectra and electronic properties of the implicitly solvated dyes were similar in the two solvents. However, MD simulations presented some fundamental differences between the dye exposed to water vs. acetonitrile interfaces. These include differences in the structural re-orientation of the dye moieties, the solvation behavior of the dye functional groups, and the transport properties of the electrolyte ions. The computational framework described in this work would be helpful in identifying ideal materials for the DSSC and rationally designing the electrode-electrolyte interface using molecular predictions.Reference:[1] Mohandass, G.; Kim, T.; Krishnan, S.

    "abstract": "AbstractMonolayer films are well recognized as a tool to design surfaces with tuned surface interactions (e.g. water-or oil-repellent surfaces) through modification of the film chemistry[1].Such films have also been used to design films that are tunably responsive to external media, such as different solvents or pH[2,3].However, these films are typically prohibitively slow in their responsiveness. In this work we aim to design surfaces that are immediately and reversibly switchable in response to a change in solvent through molecular dynamics simulations. Atomistic amorphous silica surfaces have been functionalized with short alkylsilane chains terminated with functional groups that are composed of competing hydrophobic and hydrophilic subgroups using the MoSDeF design framework[4].Such terminal groups can achieve a dynamic switching response through molecular reorientation of the individual hydrophobic/hydrophilic groups in response to switching from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic solvent. The relative size of these groups are varied and the difference in film structure is studied under water and n-hexane. It is shown that the interface is responsive to the nature of the solvent, and the degree of switchability is strongly affected by the length of the terminal group. Parameters are evaluated as quantifiable metrics for switchability which provide information about how the terminal group orients to define the solid liquid interface. These novel parameters will act as an objective function for understanding the types of responsive switching that can occur within the vast parameter space of these films.ReferencesM. C.
