    "abstract": "AbstractQuantum confined nanomaterials are at the core of most photocatalysts due to the superior functional properties exhibited by these materials when compared to their bulk counterparts. However, conventional nanomaterial syntheses often involve high temperatures, organic solvents, and multi-step processing, which limits the scalability of their production. In contrast, nature synthesizes nanomaterials under low temperature, aqueous conditions through the enzymatic processes including biomineralization. Our focus has been to create alternative green synthesis pathways while maintaining functional performance. This is achieved by understanding and controlling the nanocrystal growth mechanism, and through minimization of the system complexity down to isolating the single enzyme responsible for inducing crystal growth in solution. We then produce highly active materials via low temperature, aqueous phase, post-synthetic processing to create photocatalysts that are comparable to, or outperform, those made through conventional syntheses. In this talk I will focus on our work in cadmium sulfide-based hydrogen evolution photocatalysts, in which we have self-assembled cadmium sulfide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites and cadmium sulfide/zinc sulfide core/shell nanocrystal photocatalysts both with hydrogen evolution rates comparable to the conventionally synthesized materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this talk we will present our recent studies of how the local structure of Zr-sites in zirconia-based catalysts affect their activity and selectivity for reactions important in the upgrading of biomass-derived molecules. Zr site structures were varied using single crystal surfaces, ZrO2particles infiltrated into high surface area supports, and ultra-thin ZrO2films on oxide supports. The latter involved the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to produce conformal ZrO2films less than 2 nm in thickness, as well as isolated Zr sites. Specific examples that will be presented include structure-activity relationships for the dehydra-decylcization of cyclic ethers, transfer hydrogenation and etherification of hydroxymethylfurfural, and Diels–Alder cycloaddition of ethylene to dimethylfuran. In all cases dimensionally confined ZrO2exhibited catalytic properties that varied significantly from that of the bulk oxide. For example, the activity and selectivity for the dehydra-decylcization of THF to produce butadiene was found to increase with ZrO2film thickness in the nanometer regime. The opposite trend was observed, however, for cycloaddition of ethylene to dimethylfuran, where bulk ZrO2was nearly inactive, while nm thick ZrO2films in SBA-15 and isolated Zr sites substituted into zeolite beta both exhibited high activity for this reaction. The insights these results provide for identifying the active sites on ZrO2surfaces will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRecently, Wanget al.[1,2] have found a promising class of catalysts for CO2conversion to methanol based on immobilized cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) derivatives. It was found that both the support and the CoPc functionalization strongly impacted both activity and selectivity to methanol. Carbon monoxide adsorption strength is considered the key descriptor in methanol selectivity and thus it has been posited that the support and functionalization allow the CO adsorption to be tuned for an optimal balance between activity and selectivity towards the desired methanol product. To investigate this possibility at the single molecule level, we have begun applying non-contact atomic force microscopy (NC-AFM) to CO interactions with CoPc derivatives adsorbed on different surfaces; this talk focuses on CoPc on Ag(111). It was found that all of the CoPc molecules adsorb in equivalent configurations on the Ag surface. By tethering a CO molecule to the end of the tip, the molecular structure of the catalyst could be imaged. Moreover, the three-dimensional AFM method was applied with the CO functionalized tip to obtain quantitative force and potential energy maps of the interaction between the tethered CO molecule and CoPC. From this data, maps of equilibrium distances and potential energies at these distances could be generated. In addition, by simultaneously measuring the tunneling current decay, variations in the work function were imaged which provide insight into the charge transfer and distribution around the molecule. Continuing work is focusing on how these interactions are influenced by CoPc substituents, the supporting surface and proximity to defects, e.g. steps.[1] Y. Wu, Z. Jiang, X. Lu, Y. Liang, and H.

    "abstract": "AbstractUndercoordinated midrow transition metals have unique electronic properties that make them promising catalysts for a range of reactions. Nevertheless, their properties are notoriously challenging to characterize experimentally or computationally, and it is difficult to know beforehand how a material will perform. I will describe our efforts to overcome these limitations in two classes of single site materials: doped graphitic carbon materials containing metal centers in so-called single atom catalysts (SACs) as well as at open metal sites in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). I will describe how we have accelerated the screening of both classes of materials to address the challenge of direct partial oxidation of methane to methanol. In the case of single atom catalysts, we exhaustively screen for promising co-dopants and unearth design principles for when co-dopant atoms will improve reaction energetics. We also analyze the poor performance of scaling relations, suggesting that decoupling of reaction energies is more feasible on these SACs. In the case of MOFs, although thousands of MOFs have been synthesized, relatively few have been screened for their promise in catalysis. I will describe our high-throughput virtual screening workflow that identifies MOFs from a diverse space of experimental MOFs that have not been studied for catalysis, yet are thermally stable, synthesizable, and have promising unsaturated metal sites for C–H activation via a terminal metal-oxo species. I will describe how we carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the radical rebound mechanism for methane to methanol conversion on models of the secondary building units (SBUs) from nearly 100 MOFs. We again will show how previously observed scaling relations between oxo formation and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) are disrupted by the greater diversity of coordination environments in our MOF set.

    "abstract": "AbstractAtomically dispersed carbon-based materials such as single atom catalysts (SACs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising electrocatalysts toward various electrochemical reactions. However, their activity, selectivity, and stability are largely dependent on external factors. Here we found that the square planar geometry of NiN4strongly prefer (~ -1 eV) a low spin (LS) state (S=0, singlet) than any other spin state. However, NiN4prefers to be high spin (HS) states (S=1, triplet) when it breaks planar symmetry to tetrahedrally distorted structure (D2d symmetry). Our calculated Aiso value for non-planar tetrahedrally distorted structure with dihedral angle between planes 153° to 123° very close to experimentally measured value of 20±5 MHz. Later, we applied constant potential approach using VASPsol implicit solvation for OER and ORR thermodynamics calculations on M-N4C4(M = Co, Fe, Mn) moiety. We found that Fe-SAC OER activity largely depends on pH (Higher pH better activity) where Mn, Co-SAC shows insignificant effects. Co-SAC shows highest activity (overpotential 1.76 V) at acidic condition while Mn-SAC in basic conditions (1.75 V). Another interesting carbon-based material is MOF, consists of two distinct metal sites M1 and M2 where M1 is a phthalocyanine moiety and M2 is a node. Herein, we report a family of nine 2D-phthalocyanine MOF-based catalysts for alkaline ORR, where M = Co, Ni, Cu. Among all combinations, we found that Ni (M1) – Co (M2) combination has the best overall activity and delivers 5 mA cm-2at 0.7 V vs. RHE. Our calculation predicts that Ni as M1 is highly selective for H2O2formation whereas Co as M2shows excellent activity for ORR.

    "abstract": "AbstractAchieving a sustainable energy future is critical to overcoming the ever-increasing energy demands, reducing our dependence on conventional energy sources based on fossil fuels, and impeding climate change. One aspect of this grand challenge involves developing sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies to convert electricity into fuels and chemicals, as renewable energy sources (solar, wind, and hydroelectric) are intermittent. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) play a critical role in such technologies; however, the energy efficiencies have been hampered by the sluggish kinetics of OER and ORR.1To date, the best–known catalysts in acidic solution for OER are IrO2and RuO2and for ORR are Pt-based materials. However, these catalysts have overpotentials of ~ 0.3 V, and most importantly, the high cost and scarcity of IrO2, RuO2, and Pt and the limited stability under high oxidative potentials hinder their commercial viability. Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on acid-stable oxides have emerged as an important class of electrocatalysts due to the prospects of maximizing the efficiency of precious metal utilization, developing well-defined single-site materials, and as a potential strategy to break the scaling relations.2In this work, we selected SnO2as an acid-stable oxide host material and considered 29 elements corresponding to 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals as SACs. First, we systematically analyzed the thermodynamic and aqueous stability and activity of these SACs. Then, we performed a high-throughput screening3of the ORR and OER activity to identify the most promising SAC candidates for experimental validation. Based on these theoretical findings, rational catalyst design principles for next-generation SACs based oxygen electrocatalysts are established.1Seh, Z.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe selective transformation of biomass-derived platform molecules into value-added fuels and chemicals plays an essential role in biomass upgrading[1]. M-N-C catalysts have attracted increasing attention due to their theoretical 100% atom efficiency, high selectivity, and tunable electronic structure[2-3]. However, there is limited understanding of how they might be optimized using activity descriptors. Here we conduct the first study on the structure-activity relationship of Fe-N-C catalysts for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) reaction by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We investigate the CTH mechanism of furfural to furfuryl alcohol over a set of edge-hosted Fe-N3sites embedded in the edge of graphene ribbons. We reveal the origin of the CTH activity at the molecular orbital level and demonstrate that the Fe 3dz2orbital plays a vital role in the binding of the hydride transfer transition state. From the geometric perspective, we find that the elevation of the Fe atom induced by the Fe-N3distortion strengthens the binding of adsorbates and correlates well with the CTH activity. Finally, we establish a structure-activity relationship using a simple descriptor of the Fe-N bond length. This work provides insights into the origin of CTH activity and guidelines for designing high-performance Fe-N-C catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAdhesion energy is an important property of supported metal catalysts that dictates the nanoparticle shape through Winterbottom construction(Winterbottom, Acta Metallurgica (1967)), determines the chemical potential of metal atoms(Campbell and Mao, ACS Catal. (2017))and is a descriptor for sintering(Hu and Li, Science (2021)). We present a general model to estimate the adhesion energies of epitaxial transition metal films supported on 2D/3D carbides and nitrides. These materials are an emerging class of catalysts supports because of their exquisitely tuneable surface chemistry and bulk composition. Their surfaces can be terminated with unary or binary combinations of p-block elements like C*/F*/O*/N*. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the differential adhesion energies become independent of thickness after progressively adsorbing up to three metal layers. We construct a Born-Haber cycle to calculate the adhesion energy from the cohesive energy, strain energy, and binding energy of metal atoms on V2C MXene. The latter is estimated using a linear model containing features like electronegativity of terminations, work function, and strain, which qualitatively describe the electronic structure and geometry of supported metal systems. Adhesion energies of metal on supports containing binary terminations are obtained using a linear combination of adhesion energies on the corresponding unary terminations. Our model is generalizable across a wide range of surface terminations with an accuracy of 0.05 eV/Å2and exhibits easier transferability to supports like Ti3N2, Mo3N2and WC. Adhesion energies and adsorption energies of single atoms are linearly correlated with an error of 0.25 eV. Hence, our model also estimates the stability of single atom catalysts on supports. Changing the surface termination can alter adhesion energies such that theheterostructure lies at apex of the sintering volcano plot(Hu and Li, Science (2021)).The ability to predict adhesion energy from the elemental properties facilitates efficient identification of sintering-resistant catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn CO2electroreduction, a crucial step of C-C coupling through dimerization of adsorbed *CO has been identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) for C2+products formation over Cu-based catalysts. This phenomenon provides an opportunity to design cascade reactions through CO intermediate to improve the yield of C2+products. Bimetallic tandem catalysts integrating Cu with a CO-generation metal were widely used to improve C-C coupling kinetics. However, when the tandem catalyst is applied in the conventional GDE comprising one homogeneous catalyst layer (CL), the CO utilization efficiency for C-C coupling is low because the local CO concentration throughout the CL is at the lowest level. Distinguished from the tandem catalysts, we introduce tandem electrodes, where the temporal and spatial CO concentration profiles arein-situmanaged, to enhance the utilization of CO and thus drive cascade CO2àCOàC2+conversion with a yield at an industrial scale. We demonstrated that segmented tandem electrodes, even incorporating the commercial Cu nanoparticles, could reach over 90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+products (60% FE for C2H4) at a partial current density of above 1 A cm-2. To further promote the selectivity toward a single product (e.g., C2H4), the Cu surface needs to be modified to tune the direction of selectivity-determining step following the C-C coupling reaction. We modulated the Cu surface by single-site doping to stabilize desired selectivity-determining intermediate, from which the formation of C2H4versus C2H5OH branches. As a result, the selectivity toward C2H4versus C2H5OH was controlled relatively. When the surface-modified Cu catalyst was integrated into the segmented tandem electrodes, the FE of C2H4could be further increased to 70% at a partial current density of >1.5 A cm-2. This presentation demonstrates the collective control of rate-determining and selectivity-determining steps to direct CO2conversion to a specific C2product at high production rates.",

    "abstract": "AbstractReducing Carbon Dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere is a major global challenge that requires major improvement and innovation. Integration of CO2capture (from the air or concentrated point sources) and CO2conversion into a single unit process using a catalytic membrane potentially offers a more energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative to current sorbent-based processes. We present poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) based membranes which are permeable and selective for CO2separation from mixed gases and catalytically active for cyclic carbonate synthesis at mild temperatures. The nitrogen functional group in P4VP selectively captures and concentrates CO2at the catalytic interface for CO2reduction reaction, producing more valuable products. Furthermore, the quaternization of P4VP with alkyl halides can tune CO2separation performance and catalytic activity. We focus on how various degrees of quaternization impact the catalytic activity of P4VP for the model reaction of cyclic carbonate synthesis from CO2and epichlorohydrin (ECH), an epoxide. Quaternized P4VP with varying carbon chain length was prepared and their catalytic activity was measured with a batch reaction in dry and wet conditions. Cyclic carbonate production rate increased with respect to carbon chain length but also promoted solubility of the catalyst into the epoxide. Finally, catalytic performance decreased when operating at wet conditions due to the halogen present in the quaternized P4VP shielding the functional group from water, preventing it to perform as a Hydrogen Bond Donor (HBD). Therefore, catalyst samples using a different halogen were studied, resulting in increased catalytic performance in wet conditions due to the weaker intermolecular bond between this halogen and functional group. This study could lead to the development of more rational designs of a highly efficient bifunctional membrane with effective CO2capture and conversion and used to study more complicated CO2conversion reactions to further develop next generations of catalytic membranes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPerforming CO2reduction (CO2R) in acidic conditions can enable high single-pass CO2conversion. However, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) prevails in acidic conditions and limits the CO2R selectivity for multi-carbon (C2+) products. Herein, we present an electrodeposited copper (EC-Cu) catalyst that suppresses HER and promotes selective CO2R to C2+products in acidic conditions. Combining in situ spectroscopy, DFT calculations, and catalyst performance, we show that co-adsorbed CO and OH on the catalyst surface promote C-C coupling, which we correlate with evidence of increased CO residence time. With optimization, the EC-Cu catalyst achieved a 60% faradaic efficiency for C2H4and 90% for C2+. Using a slim flow cell, we obtained a 20% energy efficiency toward ethylene production using the EC-Cu catalyst.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMethanol synthesis via CO2hydrogenation, unlike CO hydrogenation, occurs concurrently with reverse water-gas shift (RWGS), thereby reducing methanol selectivity. We report that CO2hydrogenation rates and selectivity are single-valued functions of hydrogen pressure; while CO2partial pressure does not impact methanol selectivity during CO2hydrogenation on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, increasing H2partial pressure enhances methanol selectivity as methanol synthesis exhibits an apparent first order dependence on PH2while RWGS is zeroth order in PH2. These apparent reaction orders persist from CO2:H2= 1:1 to 1:120 such that changes in PH2can increase methanol selectivity from 5 to 80%. Rate measurements on Cu/Al2O3catalysts in combination with in situ chemical titrations using methylene chloride demonstrate that site density is invariant with H2partial pressure; the apparent first order dependence on PH2for methanol synthesis indicates a dearth of H* species at all process conditions during CO2hydrogenation on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3.Partial pressures of products were varied both by purposeful addition of product species to the CO2/H2feedstock and by operation of reaction under reversible regimes. These results consistently demonstrate H­2O preferentially inhibits the unidirectional forward rate of methanol synthesis while CO inhibits methanol synthesis and RWGS equally such that methanol selectivity is unchanged. These differences in H2O and H2dependencies suggest distinct pathways and intermediates for methanol synthesis and RWGS. Altogether, our work provides novel kinetic and mechanistic insights regarding rates and reversibility of elementary steps involved in CO2hydrogenation on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGreenhouse gases like CO2, mainly produced from fossil fuel combustion, are one of the primary reasons for global warming and climate change. The carbon-neutral conversion of CO2to methanol, using renewable hydrogen, provides a sustainable and lucrative technology for combating CO2emissions. Metal/metal-oxide systems are among the popular catalysts to facilitate selective CO2conversion to methanol, owing to their tunability and diverse catalytic functionality1. Among these, Cu nanoparticles supported on ZrO2are one of the widely studied catalysts, attributed to their high catalytic activity and versatile properties2. More recently, the inverse structured ZrO2/Cu catalysts have shown improved performance for CO2hydrogenation compared to supported ones3. However, the nature of active sites and the synergistic effect between the Cu and ZrO2components remains elusive.In this work, we utilize Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to study atomistic models representing supported and inverted Cu-ZrO2systems. We elucidate electronic changes induced in the metal and oxide components for both systems. We compute the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates relevant to CO2hydrogenation at interfacial and proximal sites for both and interface them to CO2hydrogenation rates through descriptor-based microkinetic modelling. We observe higher predicted activity of the inverted catalysts over supported one, consistent with experimental results, which can be attributed to more favorable electronic interactions and charge transfer characteristics in the former system.1.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe synthesis of fuels via CO2hydrogenation is a key milestone in the circular carbon economy. Moreover, CO2-derived fuels are relevant to the U.S. Navy’s seawater-to-fuel process, which employs CO2and H2produced via seawater electrolysis to provide carrier groups with fuel autonomy overseas. A proposed synthesis pathway involves the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS, CO2+ H2→ CO + H2O), followed by Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS, nCO + (2n+1)H2→ CnH(2n+2)+ nH2O). Given that typical FTS catalysts are also active for the Sabatier reaction (CO2+ 4H2→ CH4+ 2H2O), one hindrance of this pathway is the separation of the CO2from the RWGS-synthesized CO. Hence, there’s a demand for efficient low-temperature FTS catalysts, capable of activating CO to produce C5+ products while avoiding the undesired CO2methanation reaction.In this work, we employed Density Functional Theory (DFT) to understand the nature Ru-Co Single-Atom Alloy (SAA) catalysts, experimentally found by our collaborators to be active for low-temperature FTS. DFT-calculated segregation trends reveal that Ru single atoms are likely located on the surface, in accordance with experimental characterization. Furthermore, DFT-computed CO and CO2adsorption energies confirm that CO2does not participate in the hydrogenation chemistry, as it does not chemisorb on any of the catalytically relevant systems. Remarkably, Ru isolated atoms were not found to improve activity and selectivity towards the desired C5+ products, as observed in elementary reaction pathways of carbon coupling and C-H dissociation reactions. Instead, computed oxygen-vacancy formation energies show that the role of Ru is to promote the reduction of Co species, enabling catalytic activity for CO hydrogenation without pre-reduction. This work not only demonstrates the effective use of Ru promoters on Ru-Co SAA for low-temperature FTS, but also opens a new avenue for the exploration of other Co-based SAA catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe idea of using CO2as a soft oxidant for thermochemical ethane dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) has generated extensive interest in recent years, as the process could utilize waste CO2to offset the substantial emissions associated with conventional ethylene production. Unfortunately, CO2-ODH has a high activation energy and is equilibrium-limited, with both factors contributing to low single-pass yields. To circumvent these constraints, we propose to oxidatively dehydrogenate ethane via a molten-salt-mediated chemical looping scheme (MM-ODH). MM-ODH valorizes ethane-rich shale gas and concurrently upgrades CO2emissions by using a molten carbonate medium to segregate ethane and CO2into gas and melt phases, respectively. In the first step, ethane cracks to form ethylene and hydrogen as it bubbles through a carbonate melt. The generated hydrogen then interacts with carbonate anions in the reaction medium to form hydroxides and CO. In the second step, CO2from flue gas re-carbonates the melt to enable cyclic operation, generating steam in the process. By separating the reduction and oxidation steps into two chemical phases, equilibrium limits on conversion are alleviated. Lab-scale experiments have demonstrated ethane conversions as high as 80%, with CO2conversions and ethylene selectivities surpassing 90% under several salt compositions. Super-equilibrium CO yields (greater than ~45%) have also been realized. The resulting~1:1 ratio of ethylene to CO produced is particularly well suited for the production of propionic acid. Although C3H6O2constitutes a relatively small market, it is representative of a large number of specialty oxygenates that can be produced from ethylene and CO. With waste heat integration and carbon capture and utilization, the MM-ODH system can reduce the net carbon footprint of propionic acid production from 0.5 ton CO2emitted per ton of product to a net consumption of 0.4 ton CO2per ton of product.",

Electrocatalytic CO2 conversion is of great interest because it is scalable and can be done at ambient temperature and pressure. However, these reactions are typically performed in water which suffers from undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water breakdown. Aprotic nonaqueous electrolytes can suppress HER and enable a wider range of catalysts for CO2RR. However, water is still needed as a proton source and to stabilize charged intermediates. Here, we study the influence of aprotic electrolyte solvent on modulating the water microenvironment, solvation, and dynamics. Furthermore, we probe changes to the water chemical environment in different aprotic media and the ability of aprotic electrolytes to enhance CO2RR or suppress HER. Our work pushes the field in the understanding of electrolyte solvent and water effects for electrochemical transformations such as CO2RR and HER.",

Some of these metals are known to act as active sites in catalysts designed for the denitrification (deNOx) processes, but to date, no publications detail the use of MSW-derived ashes as a stand-alone deNOx catalyst. This work studies the activity of municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion ash in the reductive decomposition of nitric oxide. Four basic aspects were investigated: the role of oxygen in the treated gas in the catalytic performance, the equilibrium reactions responsible for observed temperature-dependent shifts in selectivity, how reductant choice impacts catalyst stability, and how pretreatment impacts performance.The presence of oxygen in the treated gas stream was shown to more than double NO conversions despite observing no change in oxygen consumption. An NO oxidation step is proposed as the mechanistic step responsible for the temperature-dependent, non-linear shift in selectivity. The presence of H2O in the treated stream resulted in ash sintering, and thus a loss in surface area, whereas the use of other reductants such as H2 and NH3 did not modify ash surface area during performance testing. Reductive pretreatment of ash improved conversion of NO by as much as double, while oxidative pretreatment depressed conversion to as little as half the conversion of as-received ash.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNewly developed detailed kinetic mechanisms are presented for PFAS pyrolysis and combustion, and their accuracy for modeling incineration reactors is demonstrated. Manufacturing and use of \"per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,\" once widely embraced for their outstanding properties, are now restricted because of their sub-ppt-level toxicity and bioaccumulation throughout the environment. Clean incineration is urgently needed to destroy PFAS into small molecules like HF, CO, and CO2without forming persistent, large-molecule byproducts.Recent data provide the basis for testing detailed kinetic mechanisms that we have predicted for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). The necessary chemical intermediates, thermochemistry, reactions, rate expressions, and transport properties have been developed using computational quantum chemistry (Gaussian at B3LYP/6-31(G(d,p) and M06-2x/6-311+G(d,p) levels), ideal-gas statistical mechanics and reaction theory (Arkane), and correlations. Testing for pyrolysis, flame, and post-flame reactor performance has primarily used the reactive-flow models of ANSYS Chemkin Pro.Modeling predictions show that pericyclic decompositions dominate pyrolysis, not radical chemistry, mainly because of the strong C-F bonds and lack of abstractable Hs. The lowest-energy decompositions from PFOA are HF elimination to make a perfluoroalkane that ends in a \"lactone\" three-membered -(CF-CO-O-) ring, decomposing to CO or CO2; a perfluoro alpha-olefin; or a 1H-perfluoroalkane. In a flame, radicals can abstract the lone H in PFOA or PFOS, respectively generating a perfluorocarboxylate or sulfonate that decomposes to release CO2or SO3, although the PFAS decompositions still compete. In conventional post-flame incineration, PFAS decompositions appear to dominate.Predictions will be tested and refined by comparison to experiments in the EPA Rainbow pilot-plant incinerator, recognizing that practical incinerators do not feed PFOA or PFOS per se but instead ionic solutions of these compounds. These findings point to control strategies for making incineration effective for the PFAS feed and for combustion intermediates.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAlkenes play an essential role in transportation fuels, constituting up to ~20% in gasoline, and are crucial intermediates and products in the combustion of hydrocarbon and oxygenated fuels. 4-Methyl-1-pentene (4M1Pen), a typical mono-branched hexene, could serve as a potential fuel to promote the knock resistance in spark-ignition engines, due to its higher research octane number when compared to hexanes. The pyrolysis was conducted in a flow reactor at 0.04 and 1 atm using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry, as well as in a jet-stirred reactor at 1 atm using gas chromatography. The laminar burning velocities (LBVs) of 4M1Pen/air mixtures were measured in a high-pressure constant-volume cylindrical combustion vessel at 373 K, 1-10 atm and equivalence ratios of 0.7-1.5. In addition, a kinetic model of 4M1Pen combustion was developed by incorporating theoretically calculated rate constants of fuel unimolecular decomposition reactions and validated against the present experimental data. Under pyrolysis conditions, the allylic C-C bond dissociation reaction (R1) is the most crucial primary decomposition reaction of the fuel. Subsequent decomposition of the primary products formed from R1 is essential for the formation of dominant product families (i.e. alkenes and dialkenes). Under flame conditions, C0-C2reactions take the dominance among the sensitive reactions, while C3-involved reactions are also influential for the flame propagation. Moreover, special attention has been paid to the fuel isomeric effects on the pyrolysis and flame propagation of 4M1Pen and 1-hexene. Compared to 1-hexene, 4M1Pen has a higher pyrolysis reactivity, due to the lower bond dissociation energy of the allylic C-C bond and the more efficient formation of H atom. However, the LBVs of 4M1Pen flames are lower than those of 1-hexene flames under the same conditions, which is mainly caused by the less prevalent production of reactive radicals especially H atom in 4M1Pen flames.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe Ostwald Process for nitric acid and consecutive fertilizer production is a key technology with an annual global capacity exceeding 100 million metric tons.[1]While the process has high selectivities for nitric oxide, the remaining selectivities to elemental nitrogen and dinitrogen oxide result in economic loss and environmental concerns.[2,3]Most current approaches for reducing laughing gas emissions focus on postprocessing rather than lowering formation during production.[4]Laboratory studies of the Ostwald Process require considerable technological requirements to mimic the harsh industrial conditions, and an increased level of control and reproducibility is needed to minimize statistical noise. A setup that allows for the independent setting of process parameters has been developed to extract information on linear and quadratic main effects and interaction coefficients. Through a combination of full factorial and central composite designs, the volume flow and heating mantle temperature were found to have limited influence on laughing gas selectivities, while pressure, ammonia volume fraction, and preheating temperature were identified as key parameters. The study provides insights into derived parameters and interaction effects and validates the system's ability to mimic industrial conditions. The findings are important as even small emission reductions can have a profound impact considering the global scale of the process. Improvements in the Ostwald Process can lead to economic benefits and a reduction in the emission of potent greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances, contributing to sustainable development.[1] C.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe emission of mercury (Hg) during the combustion of fossil fuels represents a significant threat to the global climate due to its highly toxic nature and ability to accumulate in human organisms. To date, efficient removal of harmful Hg from flue gas of coal combustion facilities can be achieved through catalytic oxidation of elemental Hg using a highly active VOx/TiO2catalyst. It has been reported that the activity of VOx/TiO2catalysts can be enhanced in reactions such as NOxreduction, N2O decomposition, and Hg oxidation by introducing modifications to the catalyst. In addition to pre- or post-treatments that impact the catalyst status, the catalytic activity of VOx/TiO2catalysts can be improved by modifying the composition of the catalytic active center. Particularly, support modification can enhance the reactivity by altering the electronic environment of VOxactive center, which is crucial for surface-reactant interaction.In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the effects of support tuning methods (e.g., crystallographic phase control and reduction treatment) on Hg oxidation activity and elucidate the changes in the electronic environment of active site. As a result, the phase control to the TiO2support improved Hg oxidation activity, while reduction treatment decreased it due to changes in the charge density at the VOxactive center. In addition, the interaction between the V site and surface Cl played a critical role in balancing two key reaction steps of HCl dissociation and HgCl2desorption, thereby influencing Hg oxidation reactivity. These findings provide valuable guidance for enhancing the activity of the VOx/TiO2catalyst in various reactions, such as Hg oxidation and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOxcompounds.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThermochemical production of hydrogen and oxygen from water using heat from a renewable energy source such as concentrated solar energy is a carbon-free route to green hydrogen. Thermochemical water splitting cycles have been investigated for many years; the cycles described fall into two major categories: (i) multistep processes that involve halides and other toxic chemicals with reaction temperatures below 1000 °C, and (ii) two step processes using metal oxide-based solids that require temperatures well above 1000 °C. Some of us have reported on a multistep cycle that utilizes manganese oxides and sodium carbonate that operates at around 850 °C. This cycle has been investigated by others throughout the world and it is claimed to be one of the most promising cycles for industrial implementation. HGenium, Inc. is developing a process framework for the implementation of this chemistry on a continuous basis.We report a “first of its kind” continuous thermochemical water splitting process that is being developed at HGenium, Inc. We show that for some energy sources (including renewable ones) the costs of heat energy can be ca. 30% the costs of generated electricity from that heat. Additionally, heat storage for 24/7 operation is less costly, relies on less costly materials and is safer than electricity storage. Initial techno-economic analyses (based on a plant producing 80 kta H2) show that the cost of hydrogen production via the HGenium, Inc. process is highly dependent on the costs of the renewable heat. However, because of the lower cost of renewable heat compared to electricity, the process can be cost compatible with desired projections, e.g., from McKinsey, for renewable hydrogen. Experimental data from laboratory reactors moving solids in the ca. 2 kilograms/day size provide supporting evidence for larger scale processing, and some of these supporting data will be presented.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMethyl cyclohexane has emerged as a promising liquid organic hydrogen carrier [1]. Methyl cyclohexane dehydrogenation to toluene is catalysed using Pt-based nanoparticles. Considering a cubo-octahedral Pt55nanoparticle as a model, we present a density functional theory (DFT) based microkinetic study. We determined the intrinsic activation barriers and thermodynamic barriers of elementary steps (Figure a). Considered pathways included methyl cyclohexane dehydrogenation to toluene, and one unselective route; toluene dissociation to benzene and methane. The degree of rate control (DRC) and the degree of thermodynamic control (DTC) were calculated to identify the rate-determining transition states and reaction intermediates, respectively. When adsorbate-adsorbate interactions were neglected, the desorption energy of toluene emerged as the sole rate-determining step. Including adsorbate-adsorbate interactions however modified the values of DRCs and DTCs (Figure b), such that both toluene desorption and the first C-H scission of methyl cyclohexane contribute to the overall rate. We constructed a linear model to determine coverage-dependent reaction energies. To reduce the computation time for transition-state calculations, another surrogate model was developed to estimate the intrinsic activation energy (ΔEact) on different active sites for all the dehydrogenation elementary steps (Figure c). This surrogate model used both thermodynamic barriers and metal-adsorbate bond lengths as inputs. The transition-state energy predicted by the surrogate model showed improved accuracy over Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations; predicting ΔEactwith errors below 0.1 eV. Coverage-dependent reaction energies and the surrogate model for determining ΔEactwere integrated within the microkinetic model. Based on the numerical solutions, an analytical expression for the reaction rate and selectivity is derived. This expression establishes the key rate determining steps that catalyst screening studies should focus on. The experimentally measured product distributions favourably compare with outputs from the microkinetic model.[1] Okada Y., Extended abstracts of the 9th Tokyo Conference on Advanced Catalytic Science and Technology, Fukuoka, KL14, (2022).",

    "abstract": "AbstractAmmonia is a good candidate as hydrogen carrier due to its high volumetric-energetic density and low liquefaction pressures, among others, where hydrogen is obtained via catalytic ammonia decomposition.

When promoting the catalyst with other metals, the negative hydrogen order typically decreases when using global power-law rate expressions. However, global rate expressions give no specific information about the elementary reaction steps.The present work explains the kinetic contribution of Ba using microkinetic rate expressions that offer additional information about the steps comprising the overall ammonia decomposition process. Combining experiments performed over a wide range of operating conditions for two Co-Ce catalysts, (with and without Ba) and the enthalpy-entropy constraints for the overall reaction, microkinetic rate parameters were optimized for both catalysts. By comparing the reaction path analyses in addition to the predicted catalytic species coverages for each catalyst, the kinetic role of Ba as a promoter is uncovered. Figure 1a-b shows the experimental and predicted NH3conversions over various temperatures and NH3partial pressures, exhibiting goodness of fit. In Figure 1 c, where the NH3and N2coverages are shown for the full range of NH3partial pressures, it can be seen that the surface coverages intercept for the Co-Ce-Ba catalyst at low NH3partial pressures while for Co-Ce they do not. Such a variation changes the elementary reaction rates, implying a change in the RDS or possibly the presence of two limiting steps for the given range. Thus, explaining the difference in activity between the promoted and non-promoted catalyst.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogen production via photocatalytic water-splitting enables a pathway towards its sustainable production, although it suffers from low efficiencies and the intermittent character of solar power, especially compared to traditional methods such as steam reforming of methane into hydrogen, and the industrially mature water electrolysis. A novel process is introduced in this work, which combines natural and artificial light to power a photocatalytic water-splitting process that can continuously run day and night. In addition, the process uses non-potable water sources to be split, based on an inhouse developed low cost organic catalyst, to achieve further environmental savings.In this study, the investigation on the coupling of the artificial (LED) and natural light sources is presented. A lab-scale photoreactor was built, with a solar simulator used as a natural sunlight source. For artificial light, several wavelengths of 10-20 strings of 3W LEDs, ranging from 365-430nm were tested, in various distributions and power levels, with the goal of optimizing hydrogen production. Distribution and placement of the LEDs was studied to provide uniform flux distribution along the reactor vessel surface. The optimal thickness of the reaction catalyst/water mix, in relation to the UV light penetration, was also quantified and modeled.Preliminary test results indicate that UV light at 380nm was optimal for hydrogen production for the Carbon Organic Framework (COF) photocatalyst used. In addition, by examining the efficiency of converting natural sunlight to electricity via photovoltaic panels, and then into artificial light via LEDs, powering the water-splitting process solely via UV-LEDs was found to be viable from a green, emission free electricity perspective, as hydrogen production via LEDs outperformed natural sunlight by up to 10x more. Nevertheless, solar driven photocatalysis still possessed an advantage of passively heating the reaction mixture, since higher than ambient temperatures were found to be positively correlated with hydrogen production.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGaseous hydrogen (H2), as a fuel, is a most promising energy source to replace non-renewable fossil fuel energy sources and will play an essential character in the greener future. High-grade H2could be produced by a water electrolysis process in which water converts into hydrogen and water through an electrochemical route. The water electrolysis process needs 1.23 V cell potential to break water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. The water electrolysis supported on biochar oxidation takes only 0.23 V cell potential, which is six times lower than the simple water electrolysis. There are several advantages to using BAWE to produce green hydrogen; (i) biochar has more significant electrochemical activity than graphite and carbon black; (ii) it has a high surface area of >500 m2/g without any treatment, which also has one of the reasons for its significant electrochemical reactivity; (iii) it is operated at <100 ℃ and ambient pressure which is different from conventional biochar gasification process; (iv) the anodic and cathodic product, i.e., CO2and H2, respectively, could be further used for methanol production; and (v) there are different types of the biomass available like bagasse, corn stover, animal manure, etc., which could be utilized to synthesize biochar for BAWE process. In this work, a different source of biochar was utilized for BAWE to produce green H2. The electrolysis of biochar-mediated electrolytes was performed at 1 V at different operating conditions, like electrolysis with and without biochar at different temperatures and chlorinated mediums. The faradic efficiencies were calculated for the anodic and cathodic products, which were oxygenated hydrocarbons and hydrogen gas, respectively. Biochar was characterized before and after electrolysis to compare the electrochemical reactivity, efficiency, and durability of the biochar. The oxygenated hydrocarbons were identified by HPLC analysis and will also be reported as a part of this work.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe demand for high-efficiency, affordable, and environmentally friendly catalysts for converting methane into COx-free hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is an ongoing and critical research area. This study investigates the kinetics of methane conversion to high-quality and high-yield carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using a Ni-Mo/MgO catalyst under varying growth temperatures and H2flow rates. The underlying mechanism of the exsolution Ni segregation from the Mo carbide surface that evolves upon methane decomposition as a function of varying Ni: Mo ratio is discussed. Our findings show how the optimal ratio of Ni to Mo results in stabilized Ni clusters that nucleate multi-walled carbon nanotubes while minimizing catalyst deactivation. As a result, we found that the optimal ratio is 1:3 with a yield of 538% (Figure 1a), with the ideal Ni to Mo ratio differing with reaction temperature. The role of other promoters (Co) and co-reactants (H2O, H2) are also discussed. This behavior is explained in the context of a kinetic model, decoupling the carburization step, steady state rates, and deactivation rates due to metal particle encapsulation, where it is revealed that the presence of the MoC sink drastically reduces catalyst deactivation rates. The prepared catalysts were characterized using: XRD, BET, and TPR, while the as-deposited carbon materials were analyzed using XRD, TEM, and Raman spectra. Overall, our results demonstrate the kinetic importance of Ni particle size and Mo carbides on the stable formation of hydrogen from methane while co-producing high-quality CNTs (Figure 1b).",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe demand for enantiomerically pure compounds as well as for asymmetric catalysis have been steadily growing in the pharmaceutical industry. However, homogenous asymmetric hydrogenation has chiral catalyst recovery and reusability issues as well as product contamination possibility due to catalyst leaching. These challenges of homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation process can be addressed by developing a heterogenous continuous flow process. The most promising approach for development of a heterogenous continuous flow process is immobilization of a chiral catalyst on a solid support. This process not only solves the catalyst separation and recycling issues but also minimizes the overall cost and provides better process control and handling.In this work, the viability of converting batch asymmetric hydrogenation to continuous flow solid-supported catalytic process will be demonstrated in an example of a key asymmetric hydrogenation step of an existing API synthesis. The most promising catalyst was identified as Rh chiral catalyst with Josiphos ligand. Homogeneous conversion and enantioselectivity results were 100% and 90% in batch screening, respectively. Several chiral catalyst immobilization methods were explored to prepare the solid Rh catalyst. Initial screening of the Rh immobilized solid chiral catalyst for asymmetric hydrogenation in batch demonstrated high enantioselectivity and low conversion compared with homogenous asymmetric hydrogenation. The catalyst immobilization on solid support procedure and heterogeneous reaction conditions were further optimized under batch conditions to achieve high conversion and enantioselectivity results that were observed in a batch homogenous asymmetric hydrogenation process. Finally, the solid supported Rh-based catalyst was tested in a packed bed reactor under continuous flow conditions. Under steady state conditions 99% conversion of the substrate and 87% enantioselectivity towards the desired enantiomer was achieved in a continuous reactor. No catalyst deactivation was observed during the duration of the continuous run. The catalyst was active for multiple continuous hydrogenation reactions.",

Guidelines for efficient and safe scale-up synthesis of MOFs are significant to industry, therefore, a detailed process kinetics and hazard analysis can provide an inherently safe design before actual implementation. In this work, from a perspective of reaction engineering and process safety, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is selected as a case example to study MOF scale-up synthesis in a solvothermal RC1ereactor coupled within-situFTIR spectroscopy under room temperature. Various stages of ZIF-8 formation at room temperature, including nucleation, growth, and stationary, were investigated to identify the 2-methylimidazole concentration evolution over time. Avrami’s equation was then used to correlate reaction kinetics based on the obtained concentration results. The reaction temperature and heat release behaviors were also simultaneously identified to prevent inconsistent product properties from resulting in thermal runaway when scaling up the ZIF-8 production from the milliliter scale to liter scale. Product properties were compared among varied ZIF-8 products using PXRD, N2adsorption, and DLS. A group of biological toxicity tests and process HAZOP analysis were conducted, and it was determined that the hazards present in the MOF scale-up synthesis process can be efficiently managed using the prevention-mitigation-response strategy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBiocatalysis is an eco-friendly alternative to conventional catalysis in synthetic chemistry. However, innovative approaches are still required to increase biocatalyst stability and make continuous flow biocatalytic processes commercially feasible.In this work, the design of continuous, inexpensive, and stable biocatalytic processes for the synthesis of fine chemicals will be discussed for different applications (Figure 1). In the first part, the design of an automated process to evaluate the efficiency of immobilized enzymes on 3D printed supports will be discussed.[1] The process was automated via a Python-based application to identify the optimal operating conditions. The process demonstrated excellent space-time yield (STY) (39.21 g product/L·h) and no leaching of the immobilized enzyme, indicating that the designed supports are ideal for biocatalytic applications.In the second part, the development of custom-made flow processes to aid in the transition from batch to continuous mode for photo-biocatalytic reactions will be discussed.[2] Two separate photo-bioreactors have been designed and optimized for carrying out light-driven biotransformations in cyanobacteria. The presented flow processes offer higher STYs compared to batch (up to 14.4 g/L·h in the coil reactor against 0.4 g/L·h in batch), and they are simple to construct and scale, rendering them a workable choice for modular and scalable systems.Lastly, a multistep continuous process will be presented,that combines photo- and biocatalysis to obtain trifluoromethyl-functionalized molecules, which are relevant for the pharmaceutical industry. The process involves the use of green solvents, biocatalyst immobilization, and cofactor regeneration to increase the sustainability of the reaction.To conclude, combining established chemical engineering technologies with greener solutions such as biocatalysis and photocatalysis is necessary to develop sustainable processes and change the way fine chemicals are produced.[1] A.

A reactive chemical system of interest is the heterogeneous nitration of 2-nitrotoluene (2-MNT), since it is a very fast reaction,[2]highly exothermic,[3]and reaction products, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), are important intermediates in fine chemical industries.[4]In this work, we utilize an autonomous flow platform equipped with continuous flow micromixers to achieve efficient mixing and ensure process safety. Work-up steps are performed in-line and phases are separated based on membrane separation. Organic phase passes through a benchtop NMR for quantification of reaction products and data are processed by an MBDoE algorithm to design the next experiment with the objective of achieving a precise estimation of kinetic parameters for a pre-selected kinetic expression.[5]References: [1]React.

    "abstract": "AbstractA multi-disciplinary group of Abbvie scientist share the development of a robust process for a piperidine fragment by transforming methylpyridine through a lithiation and contiguous non-cryogenic carboxylation, esterification, and hydrogenation chemistries with >90% yields for each individual stage.While organometallic reagents are synthetically useful to generate new carbon-carbon bonds, their formation can pose practical concerns. For example, their pyrophoric nature mandates a high-level of rigoristic handling while the generation of high exotherms represent a higher risk during scale-up due to reduced specific surface areas. Flow chemistry examples are leveraged to improve safety and obtain more robust processing conditions.Quenching organolithiates intermediates with CO2is a rapid and highly exothermic process. Based upon the measured adiabatic temperature rise (ATR) of 80⁰C and heat of reaction (∆Hrxn) of 84.7 kJ, an uncontrolled temperature profile would pose a serious risk of thermal runaway and contribute to selectivity issues. To address these areas several reaction modalities were evaluated, including impinging jets and super critical CO­2to improve CO2availability. While the latter modality was a successful proof-of-concept, current scale-up capabilities favored reverse quenching of organolithiate intermediate with CO2which produce excellent yields and purity for a wide operational range at a pilot plant scale.The esterification of the carboxylate salt was a low-risk reaction that leads to our regulatory starting material (RSM), a pyridinium salt, which must meet 99.9 PA% purity by HPLC. The RSM was hydrogenated in a flow configuration with a Trickled Packed Bed (TPB) reactor achieving excellent purity and yields. A robust process was achieved by optimizing metal-support, metal loadings, pressure, and temperature.Overall, the formation of the organolithiate starting material and subsequent reactions and respective isolations helped achieve a piperidine product purity of 99.5% that was used with other fragments to produce our pipeline asset.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) found in most modern drugs are traditionally synthesizedviabatch-style methods as opposed to continuous processing in flow reactors. While batch synthesis allows production of APIs in bulk quantities, it limits the tools and process efficiencies at the disposal of pharmaceutical engineers. Batch API synthesis requires large volume vessels in order to scale up a process; this raises safety concerns, increases capital costs, and generates variability between batches. In recent years, a new wave of pharmaceutical engineering has sought to translate batch pharmaceutical processing into continuous methods of manufacturing. While still a developing field, continuous synthesis in flow allows an API to be synthesized in plug flow reactors and offers the option of employing packed catalytic beds to efficiently drive reactions to completionvianon-equilibrium conditions.This talk examines the conversion of traditional batch API synthesis to continuous flow manufacturing for the production of albuterol. Albuterol is a beta-agonist bronchodilator used for the treatment of asthma and a current listing on the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) drug shortage list. Specifically, we highlight new methodologies of process intensificationviaflow chemistry to optimize amination and hydrogenation reactions. Practical aspects related to appropriate synthon selection to enable flow chemistry and process intensification will be discussed. Current results offer improved efficiencies versus batch synthesis as measured by liquid chromatography area percent (LCAP), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and spectroscopic techniques (Raman, IR, UV-Vis). Additionally, we demonstrate how packed bed catalytic reactors (Pd/Carbon) can be used to replace commercial batch reactors. This work will ultimately be utilized in a continuous end-to-end albuterol manufacturing plant in order to streamline API synthesis and help the U.S. mitigate critical drug shortages.",

Characterizing our catalyst materials helps to understand what specifically affects catalyst performance to aid in improving and developing better catalysts. This presentation highlights some of the“advanced”materials characterization studies undergone at BASF using both spectroscopy and microscopy.X-ray spectroscopy was employed to observe the evolution of Cu species in Cu-exchanged zeolite catalysts under steam and selective catalytic reduction(SCR) conditions. Utilizing synchrotron facilities, Near Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy(NAP-XPS) and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy(XAS) uncover critical chemical state and local atomic structural changes during these processes that take place over catalysts responsible for emission control in diesel vehicles. NAP-XPS shows the migration of copper to exchange sites inside zeolite cages during steam treatment.In-situXAS shows the transformation of Cu species during the SCR reaction. These complimentary spectroscopic techniques were used to provide clearer insight into the evolution of exchanged Cu species under these reaction conditions.X-ray Micro-Tomography(XMT) and Deep Learning(DL) was utilized to visualize Four-Way Catalyst(FWC) filters via 3D imaging and quantification to correlate microstructural features with backpressure. FWC catalysts provide three-way conversion efficiency and filtration of particulate matter simultaneously, which is required in emission control as restrictions get tighter. Backpressure generated by an FWC catalyst becomes a concern and has to be carefully controlled. 3D morphology of the FWC catalyst is suspected to have the largest effect on backpressure. XMT allows 3D imaging, which provides relevant information with respect to the 3D morphology of filters. DL allows segmentation to occur in hours, which otherwise takes days. By imaging/analyzing filters with increasing washcoat loading, we correlate what morphological features are affected by increased loading and correlate that to backpressure changes. This helps us facilitate rational design by understanding how different coating parameters affect the 3D morphology and ultimately performance.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAlkylation of aromatics with light alkenes provides reaction pathways to produce industrially important chemicals, including cumene, ethylbenzene and ethyltoluene. Acidic zeolites are widely used as catalysts although mechanistic details of this reaction have remained uncertain in the literature. This work uses toluene alkylation with ethylene as a model reaction to understand how this reaction and undesired ethylene dimerization occur on protons confined within small eight-membered ring (8-MR) and large 12-MR channels in MOR. Our in-situ infrared and theoretical analyses show that protons in 8-MR channels are inaccessible to large toluene reactants, which may infer that these protons are inactive for alkylation. To test this hypothesis, we prepared MOR samples with protons only in 12-MR by selectively titrating protons in 8-MR. In contrast to our hypothesis, measured alkylation rates (per H+) are higher for samples with protons in both 8-MR and 12-MR than those with protons only in 12-MR. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that ethoxides, formed on the protons in 8-MR side channels, can “reach” toluene in vicinal 12-MR, forming a C-C bond to form ethyltoluene product. Alkylations on protons in 12-MR followed first order in ethylene pressure and zero-order in toluene pressure, inferring π-bonded toluene as the most abundant surface intermediates (MASI); such a conclusion is consistent with our infrared and DFT results. In contrast, the reaction remained zero-order in ethylene pressure for protons in 8-MR due to the size-exclusion of toluene; ethoxides are MASI on those sites at relevant conditions. These different kinetic responses, in turn, require careful interpretation of rate data for rigorous rate and selectivity comparisons among protons in different environments. These results provide an illustrative example of “pore mouth catalysis”, where the large reactants transform into the products without directly “accessing” the active sites.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDensity functional theory (DFT) is the workhorse method of computational catalysis owing to its balance of speed and accuracy: it is fast enough to study systems relevant to catalysis (100+ atoms), and accurate enough (~0.2 eV error) to make quantitative conclusions about trends in reactivity. The core approximation in DFT is the exchange correlation functional, which maps the exact many-electron system to an approximate system of non-interacting electrons. A plethora of exchange-correlation functionals have been developed over the past five decades, many of which provide excellent accuracy for specific types of systems (e.g. metals, molecules, etc.). However, there are tradeoffs between speed and accuracy for different levels of approximation, and there is no consensus on the \"best overall\" functional, especially for the solid-gas/liquid interfaces relevant to heterogeneous catalysis. Moreover, nearly all functionals developed thus far follow Pardew's paradigm of \"Jacob's Ladder\", where the inputs to the functional are based on a limited selection of possible inputs (e.g. density, density gradient, kinetic energy density, Fock exchange energy). This talk introduces a fundamentally different paradigm of exchange-correlation functional design, where the input space is expanded to include spatially-localized multipole expansions of the electron density. The basic idea of multipole functionals will be introduced, along with some strategies that have been employed in constructing specific proof-of-concept functionals, including machine learning and data-driven approaches. The current status of self-consistent multipole functionals will be presented, along with a brief history of how a textile/chemical engineer ended up developing exchange-correlation functionals, and a perspective on the future challenges and prospects for this new class of density functionals.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPlastic waste is primarily disposed of in landfills due to difficulties in recycling and a lack of economic incentives. A promising approach to address this issue is steam gasification which thermally converts plastic waste into fuels and value-added chemicals, such as hydrogen and syngas. In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and coal refuse (CR) from thickener underflow were pelletized together at varying weight contents to create a coal-like feedstock. The steam gasification of this mixture was investigated in a drop tube reactor system equipped with an on-line mass spectrometer and a tar-collecting apparatus. The effects of reaction temperature, blending ratio, and catalyst composition on conversion, product distribution, syngas quality, and tar reforming efficiency were examined. Our results showed that the carbon conversion and product distribution were strongly influenced by the reaction temperature (800-1000 °C), with higher temperatures promoting hydrogen and carbon oxides formation and suppressing tar formation. A decrease in LDPE content in the feedstock increased syngas yield but decreased syngas quality, suggesting a synergistic interaction between LDPE and CR. Moreover, incorporating Fe2O3during steam gasification significantly improved tar reforming efficiency. Other catalytic systems from natural and waste sources are being explored to further enhance syngas formation and allow control of hydrocarbon products. We have demonstrated that the co-utilization of plastic and coal wastes is a viable solution to reducing waste and producing useful products, thereby providing a pathway to a circular economy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOne of the strategies to reduce environmental issues caused by single-use plastics is chemical upcycling to value-added products. Conventional processes to produce polar waxes (used in coatings and emulsifiers) includes the oxidation of molten polyethylene (PE) under air/O2flow, radical grafting of maleic anhydride onto PE or polypropylene (PP) chains, and co-oligomerization of ethylene with a polar monomer [1]. These routes use fossil carbon-derived feedstocks, such as ethylene and propylene. In this presentation, I will describe how various PE and PP wastes can be converted directly to polar waxes via oxidative cleavage, using an alkylhydroperoxide as the oxidant. The hydroperoxide facilitates the formation of alkyl radicals by hydrogen atom abstraction from the polyolefin backbone, triggering C-C bond cleavage. GPC analysis confirms thatMnvalues of both LDPE and HDPE were decreased to ca. 1,000 g/mole (Ðca. 2), which is typical for polar waxes used for coatings. For isotactic PP,Mndecreased to ca. 1,600 g/mol (Ðca. 1.7). Similar materials are obtained for mixtures of PE and PP, as well as mixed post-consumer PP-PE waste (including dyes and labels), eliminating the need for mechanical separation. CHN analysis showed that oxygen contents of oxi-PE and oxi-PP are ca. 10 and 6 wt%, respectively. These values are 2-3 times larger than values for polar waxes produced by air oxidation of molten PE. According to IR,1H NMR, and 2D1H-13C HSQC/HMBC NMR, the functional groups in oxidized PE (oxi-PE) are predominantly internal ketones, while oxi-PP instead contains terminal methyl ketones, due to its different mechanism of chain cleavage. The mechanism for C-C bond cleavage and oxygen functionalization was further investigated using several model compounds (n-decane, 3-methylpentane, and squalane).Reference(1) Krendlinger, E., et al. \"Waxes.

    "abstract": "AbstractWithin this study, the catalytic fast pyrolysis of polyolefinic waste streams was investigated to recover valuablebase chemicals at high selectivity. We compare the energy demand and carbon footprint of this direct routewith other state-of-the-art processes. Different feeds, (virgin and post-consumer polyolefins), catalyst/feedratios, and reaction temperatures were tested in a micropyrolysis reactor coupled to two-dimensional gaschromatography. HZSM-5 zeolite was used as catalyst for upgrading the pyrolysis vapors. After a steamtreatmentat 800 °C, a phosphorus-stabilized microporous HZSM-5 and its desilicated version showed highselectivity for production of valuable base chemicals when upgrading pyrolysis vapors at 600 °C, with ~80%C2-C4 olefins and ~5% aromatics produced from virgin PE. Increasing the reaction temperature from 600 to700 °C, increased the aromatics yield to ~10 wt. % while producing similarly high overall yields of C2-C4olefins. Processing post-consumer mixed polyolefin resulted in 5-10 wt. % lower olefins yield than using virginPE but produced ~5 wt. % more aromatics due to its contamination with PS and PET. While parent HZSM-5rapidly deactivated for repeated runs owing to its high coking propensity, phosphorus-modified andsteamtreated HZSM-5 showed almost no deactivation during 130 runs with stable conversion towards C5+aliphatics and high C2-C4 olefins selectivity with a 70% reduction in coke deposition. The performance of thisdirect olefins production route was further evaluated in a plantwide context. It was found that it requires ~38%lower energy input than the step-wise counterpart (plastics pyrolysis followed by pyrolytic oil steam cracking),while it results to at least an order of magnitude lower carbon footprint as compared to peer state-of-the-artprocesses.",

    "abstract": "AbstractChemical upcycling of waste plastics into fuels and chemicals has been performed via thermal processes such as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which require severe operating conditions under aqueous conditions to depolymerize plastics (>400 °C and 25 MPa). Reducing thermal depolymerization severity would improve energy efficiency for converting waste plastics. Depolymerization has been shown to occur through radical initiated scission, where the radicals are formed from random scission or hydrogen abstraction1. In this study, the impact of HTL with the coaddition of a radical initiator (termed HTL+) is examined to promote depolymerization while reducing severity.Hydrogen peroxide was used as an external radical source to initiate β- scission of polystyrene. The effects of radical source loading and reaction temperature on oil yield and composition was examined. Addition of a radical initiator gave the most improvement in liquid yield at 350 °C, corresponding to an increase from 0% to ~90%. As the temperature was increased beyond 350 °C, non-initiated HTL yields increased monotonically while initiated HTL yields decreased. Peroxide loadings ranging from 3:1 to 10:1 on a carbon-oxidant basis were studied for a reaction temperature of 350 °C to analyze the effect of initiator on oil yields. Reducing initiator loading from 3:1 to 5:1 resulted in a decrease in oil yield and an increase in wax production indicative of partial depolymerization. Finally, the composition of the oils produced from HTL+ were analyzed using GC-MS, revealing that oils produced from initiated HTL include oxygenated compounds, such as benzaldehyde that are not present in samples obtained in the absence of initiator. These results confirm that radical initiated HTL is a new approach for plastic depolymerization that uses milder conditions than traditional HTL.Guyot, A., Polymer Degradation and Stability1986,15 (3), 219-235",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe disposal of solid waste through landfill and incineration poses a significant and costly challenge to global health, and results in the loss of a valuable resource for the circular economy. However, thermal pyrolysis of the organic components of MSW offers a scalable method for producing liquid fuels. In order to optimize this process, detailed knowledge of the associated thermochemistry and kinetics is required. This study utilizes thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and kinetic modeling to analyze the catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis of a model solid waste feedstock containing cellulose, sucrose, sugarcane bagasse, and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Results indicate that co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste, with or without catalysts, occurs in four main stages. Non-catalytic MSW pyrolysis is influenced by sample heating rates but has little effect on the temperature or mass loss during each stage. In contrast, catalytic pyrolysis is sensitive to the catalyst:feedstock mass ratio, and kinetic analysis reveals a monotonic increase in activation energy for each stage of pyrolysis. However, energy barriers for individual stages decrease with increasing catalyst:feedstock ratio and are sensitive to the catalyst type. The study shows that TGA is an effective tool for catalyst selection and process optimization, provided that low heating rates are used. Catalyst selection plays a crucial role in reducing the energy required for the pyrolysis process, and the resulting products are of great importance in determining the economics of the process.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith the continuous increase in the volume of waste plastic, plastic upcycling is a viable option as it is a fast and efficient process that produces high value products. In this work, the potential of co-upcycling polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) for enhanced aromatics production is explored in thermal reactor and microwave reactor. In the conventional thermal reactor, the plastics PS and PE were converted using ZSM-5 catalyst operated at reaction temperature of 400oC. Moreover, the interaction between PS and PE to enhance the aromatics production was studied by in-situ FTIR. While PS is capable of producing high level of aromatics, the main product from PE was straight-chain hydrocarbons. It was observed that co-upcycling of PS and PE can enhance the overall yield of aromatics and reduce the required reaction temperature. Based on these findings, a reaction scheme was proposed to describe the interaction of the plastic feedstock. When PS is present in the feedstock, PE straight chain radicals can easily crosslink with the benzene radicals produced from cracking of PS. Therefore, the concentration of monocyclic aromatics hydrocarbons was found to be significantly higher with the mixed plastic compared to pure PS and LDPE. The main product of pure LDPE and PS were alkanes and polycyclic hydrocarbons, respectively. Hence, combining two plastics in pyrolysis generates synergy that leads to the formation of specific group of desirable products.Moreover, this work features the newly microwave-driven catalytic upcycling of plastics. Microwave-driven reactor setups are known for their selective and rapid heating of materials. Therefore, the reaction temperature can be reduced even further as only the plastic-catalyst interface was heated. However, the hurdle was that plastics, unlike catalyst, are generally transparent to microwave. The ZSM-5 supported catalysts were developed for microwave-driven co-upcycling of PS and PE and demonstrated the high selectivity for aromatics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAbstractPlastic production has been continuously increasing in the last decades, but there is no effective recycling technology for plastic waste. Upcycling plastic waste into new, valuable products is considered as a promising alternative, but also challenging, to address this issue. In the United States, for example, polyurethane is one of the most important and widely used plastics. Polyurethane is mainly produced from the reaction of reaction between isocyanates and polyether polyols. Long-chain polyurethane could limit the internal diffusion of the reactant during upcycling reactions. Therefore, to increase the reaction rate, high surface areas and pore sizes are generally required for the upcycling reaction.In this study, catalytic upcycling of polyurethane was investigated with different types of MFI zeolites. Firstly, commercial H-ZSM-5 zeolites were used as a catalyst in the reaction. Product distribution, effect of polymer-to-catalyst ratios, and reaction temperatures were studied. Then, tailor-made MFI zeolites were synthesized with significantly higher surface area and pore size. Reaction products were investigated by the liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance. The synthesized catalysts were characterized, using ammonia temperature-programmed desorption, nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction, magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, andscanning electron microscope. Furthermore, the spent catalysts were analyzed, using thermogravimetric analysis and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. Advantages of the synthesized catalysts over commercial H-ZSM-5 catalysts were studied. Catalytic decomposition pathways of the polyurethanes were postulated, based on information from our experimental results and from the literature. The findings pointed out that catalytic upcycling of polyurethane waste had a positive contribution to promoting plastic recycling, energy security, waste management, and environmental protection.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), as well as other polyolefins, is researched often as a way to convert plastic waste into valuable fuels and chemicals. The utilization of zeolite catalysts during polyolefin pyrolysis helps to decrease pyrolysis temperature as well as increase the yield of target products. The catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic is not researched as often, as while it can result in high yields of benzene, it also forms high yields of catalytic coke. Polyolefins and PET can be found together in unsorted plastic waste and are inherently mixed in multilayer packaging. Researching the catalytic co-pyrolysis of these two types of plastic is vital for the push towards a circular economy. In previous works it was shown that interactions occur between polyolefins and PET during their catalytic co-pyrolysis with zeolite catalysts. These lead to an increase in alkylated benzenes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and a decrease in benzene and C3-C6 paraffins and olefins. What is not understood, is the effect of pyrolysis operating conditions on these interactions that were observed.To investigate, we conducted the catalytic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of LDPE and PET with zeolite catalysts using a tandem micro-reactor connected to a two-dimensional gas chromatography system with flame ionization detector and time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Over 190 chemical products were identified with match factor above 800, and quantified using the effective carbon number approach. Thermogravimetric analysis was used to determine the solid residual yield. Operating conditions such as temperature, catalyst contact mode, and pyrolysis time were varied. Increasing the temperature from 380°C to 500°C contributed to higher levels of interactions which increased toluene yield and decreased benzene yield from what was expected. Further insights into the impact of other operating conditions will help to determine optimal conditions for the catalytic co-pyrolysis of PET with polyolefins.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical CO2reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers an efficient strategy to upcycle anthropogenic CO2gas into value-added fuels. Until now, copper (Cu) is the first choice as a catalyst for electrochemical CO2reduction. While Cu-based electrocatalysts can form desirable C2+products, they have shown drastic change in structure and morphology which eventually limits its stability. During CO2RR, surface Cu-atoms go through cathodic corrosion, and as a result, leach out from surface to electrolyte via intermediate Cu-compounds which later reduce back to elemental Cu and form nanoparticle either in solution or redeposit to surface. However, Cu dissolution mechanism during CO2RR is still a highly debatable issue within CO2RR community. In this study, we aim to understand the detail thermodynamics and kinetics of Cu dissolution mechanism during CO2RR to design stable Cu-catalyst. Herein, a first principles density functional theory (DFT) approach is used to simulate Cu-corrosion under CO2RR conditions. As a model surface, we employed Cu (211) surface with a kink site. We assume that oxygen atoms from the oxide bulk diffuse to Cu-surface and form transient CuxOyintermediate which eventually get dissolved and later reduced back to elemental Cu-atoms. The thermodynamic stability of such CuxOyintermediate compounds were tested in terms of Gibbs free energy derived from DFT calculations. In addition to thermodynamic stability, we also studied the kinetics in terms of diffusion barrier calculations. We implemented nudged elastic band (NEB) method to estimate the diffusion barriers. We also investigated the role of applied potential, pH,internal strain due to the lattice mismatch as well as the reaction intermediate species i.e., hydrogen (H), hydroxyl ion (OH-) etc., towards the Cu corrosion process. The data obtained from theoretical calculations were also corroborated with available experimental observations. Finally, the details of this study will be presented during the conference.",

This tethering strategy improved both the stability of the catalysts and their Faradaic Efficiency (FE). DNA-catalyst conjugates were immobilized on screen-printed carbon electrodes and carbon paper electrodes via DNA hybridization with nearly 100% efficiency. Following immobilization, higher catalyst stability at relevant potentials is observed. Additionally, lower overpotentials are required for CO generation.

    "abstract": "AbstractControlling the selectivity of CO2electro-reduction to one specific product has emerged as a long-standing challenge in catalysis. While strain, alloying, and nano structuring have been used to create active sites, tuning selectivity by manipulating the charged state of active sites is less studied. In our recent study, gold nanoparticles supported on InP and TiO2were employed to showcase the impact of charged states of Au sites on the composition of syngas during electro-reduction of CO2(Liu G. et al., ACS Catal. (2021)).Building upon this observation, we demonstrate how the selectivity of CO2reduction to various products (e.g., syngas and C1+) can be influenced by manipulating the charged state of supported metal sites. Our set of materials comprises of low-strain (< 5%) epitaxial films and moiré patterns of Au, Ag, and Cu monolayers supported on 2D/3D transition metal carbides and nitrides. The surface terminations of supports include single and mixed p-block elements which induce distinct charge states on the metal sites. Based on a paradigm introduced by Tang et al.(Appl. Catal. B Environ. (2020)),we use adsorption energies of CO* and OH* as reactivity descriptors to classify the trends in selectivity. We construct metal-specific linear scaling relations between adsorption energies of reaction intermediates in CO2electro-reduction and the reactivity descriptors. The scaling relations exhibit slopes that deviate from the bond order conservation principles observed in unsupported metallic systems. These scaling relations, when combined with free energy equilibrium conditions, are utilized to establish selectivity boundaries for different competing pathways, such as HCOO*/COOH* pathways and CH4/C2/H2product formation. We present a novel approach for tailoring the selectivity of electrocatalysts for CO2reduction by controlling interfacial charge transfer. Our model allows for quick evaluation of the selectivity of metal/support heterostructures, broadening the range of potential catalysts beyond Cu and its alloys.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical reduction of CO2is promising way to take advantage of renewable energy to produce value added chemicals and fuels as well as mitigating the increasing CO2emission. Most studies of CO2reduction so far have focused on single-pass measurements, with carbon-conversion efficiencies (CCEs) being limited to <10%. Here we report on the continuous gas-to-liquid conversion for carbon-efficient electroreduction of CO2. A GDE-based CO2electrolyzer with the integration of gas and liquid circulation system is designed to utilize the unreacted reactants in single pass and thus enhance the CCE and enrich products in the flowing electrolyte. In this study we prove this recirculation design by conducting continuous electroreduction of CO2to formate. Formate (or the derived formic acid) is one of the products that can make the CO2electroreduction process economic. It’s widely used in textile, leather and pharmaceutical industries. When applied a commercial tin oxide catalyst in our novel recirculation system, we can achieve a 95% faradaic efficiency towards sodium formate with over 100 mA/cm2at a voltage of 2.65 V. Meanwhile a two-week-long continuously production of sodium formate solution with over 90% carbon conversion efficiency is demonstrated to highlight the robustness of both the catalytic material and the reported electrochemical system. The as-produced solution with > 100 mmol/L sodium formate is an ideal C-1 feedstock for biosynthesis utilizing formate metabolic pathway such as poly(hydroxyalkanoates) production.",

Catalyst design by tuning the surface CO binding strength shows near 80% FEs and over 100 mA cm-2current densities in flow-type electrolyzers.

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon capture is an emerging process for mitigating negative climate change impacts bycapturing CO 2 emissions from industrial processes (point source capture), or removing CO 2directly from air (direct air capture). Current commercial sorbent-based CO 2 capture processesare prohibitively expensive because they require energy intensive regeneration stages to releaseCO 2 and regenerate the sorbent. Additionally, they produce CO 2 streams that must be compressedand transported to sites for storage, which reduces efficiency. In this talk, I will discuss a novelcatalytic membrane technology that we are developing that potentially enables commerciallyviable CO 2 capture by integrating CO 2 capture and CO 2 conversion to value-added chemicals in asingle unit process operated continuously at mild conditions. Such a membrane acts as both theCO 2 separation and conversion medium, providing an energy- and atom-efficient alternative tosorbent-based CO 2 capture, compression, transport, and storage. We have recently discoveredthat poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP)-based membranes are promising for demonstrating thepotential of amine-functionalized membranes as an integrated CO 2 capture and conversionplatform tunable. I will demonstrate that P4VP-based membranes are permeable and selectiveCO 2 separation membranes that are also catalytically active for cyclic carbonate synthesis at mildconditions (57 °C, 1 atm CO 2 ). The performance of P4VP for CO 2 separation and for catalyticconversion of CO 2 can also be enhanced by quaternization of PVP with alkyl halides. Finally, Iwill demonstrate that quaternized P4VP-based membranes can integrate CO 2 capture fromextremely dilute sources (~0.1 kPa CO 2 , i.e., similar to the CO 2 concentration in air) and convertit with epoxides to cyclic carbonates in a single membrane reactor operated at mild temperatures(57 °C) and atmospheric pressure.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe use of high pressure circulating fluidized bed (HPCFB) reactors has recently emerged as a promising technology in chemical conversions, particularly for sustainable fuel and chemical processes. These reactors have several advantages over conventional reactors, including higher rates of heat and mass transfer, improved mixing of reactants, and the ability to recycle catalysts with high recirculating solid flow rates for heat recovery. HPCFBs are particularly suitable for high-temperature, high-pressure processes such as gasification, pyrolysis, and hydrotreating.At SwRI, we have developed HPCFBs and the supporting infrastructure for practical applications, ranging from small-scale laboratory experiments to larger pilot-scale HPCFBs. These reactors can efficiently convert both renewable and petrochemical feedstocks into valuable end products. Additionally, HPCFBs can utilize, capture and recycle CO2, leading to fewer undesirable side reactions and pollutants.Our ongoing work on refining processes primarily focuses on the gasification and pyrolysis of biomass, biogenic oils, plastics, and municipal waste streams into hydrogen and value-added carbon product fractions that are integrated with carbon capture and use. We have overcome several limitations, such as reactor design, fluidization efficiencies, and regenerative circulation, through several years of applied research. We are also currently researching the use of HPCFBs for simultaneous cracking and hydrotreating of various feedstocks into high-demand fuels.Our goal at SwRI is to advance HPCFB technologies through fundamental research, process development, and industrial realization, with the aim of promoting a sustainable energy and material economy. Through numerous and diverse projects completed over several decades, we are constantly striving to achieve this goal. This presentation will provide an overview of the various uses and advancements in HPCFB for low-carbon fuel and chemical production.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRemoval of CO2from energy-rich, partially-combusted gas streams has broad application in integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) processes, sorption-enhanced water-gas shift technology (SEWGS) for hydrogen production, and blast-furnace top gas in steel manufacture. Enhancing the energy content and removing the CO2 for sequestration or use is an ideal opportunity for process intensification via sorption-enhanced reaction, in which CO2is chemically fixed to a suitable sorbent, thus driving the equilibrium produce more hydrogen at lower temperatures. Lithium-based CO2sorbents, notably lithium orthosilicates (Li4SiO4,or LOS), have been evaluated as candidates for this purpose. A novel surfactant-assisted approach to preparing a nanostructured LOS has been developed by adding a polyether amine surfactant to the sol-gel preparations. The novel synthetic approach generates aproduct-likeprecursor phase with nanoscale domains of lithium metasilicate and lithium carbonate stabilized by a carbonaceous component that originates from the degradation of citrate and surfactant species. Preferred LOS compositions sorb 26 wt% CO2within 1 minute from a 50 vol% CO2/N2stream and show no observed loss in a 33 wt% working capacity in over 30 one-hour isothermal steam cycles. Physically meaningful rate constants and diffusivities are provided by a piece-wise adaptation of the Ishida and Wen core-shell model, confirming faster reaction and diffusion kinetics for these high-performing CO2sorbents. An overall working hypothesis of key results helps to explain robustness in sorption cycling and suggests the advantages of a product-focused sorbent design.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOur planet must address pressing global issues such as climate change, food and water quality, and growing energy demand. Chemical engineering, including reactor design and catalysis development, are crucial to efficient production of fuels and chemical precursors and removal of toxins and pollutants from water and food sources. My research team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory focuses on pioneering solutions to these challenges by combining advanced manufacturing (AM) and electrochemical engineering. Together, these approaches can be used to design and control catalyst structures, optimize fluid dynamics, and understand mass transport phenomena from the sub-micron through the centimeter length scales; ultimately, my team and I are using AM reactors to shift the paradigm on how we create next generation of chemical reactors.I will share results from our recently published work where we produced the first 3D-printed vapor-fed reactor (VFRs) for electrochemical CO2reduction. These AMVFRs provide effective delivery of CO2and result in remarkable selectivity to multi-carbon products, improved single pass CO2conversion, and high ethylene and ethanol yields compared to the literature. I will also share preliminary results on how we are using AM reactors to convert air and water directly into ammonia using renewable electricity at ambient conditions. This process uses 30% less energy input compared to the current Haber-Bosch technology and moves us toward a decarbonized process for building the fundamental chemical for fertilizers, enabling decentralized production while drastically reducing the energy and carbon footprint of synthesizing ammonia. Finally, I will share how my nonprofit, the Feaster Foundation, focuses on supporting underserved students who are passionate about helping others, as the development of brilliant engineers is just as important as the development of incredible reactors.This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPhotochemistry, the use of visible or ultraviolet light to initiate chemical reactions, is an electron driven reaction that is considered to be more efficient than traditional thermal driven chemistries. Despite this, its widespread adoption in the chemical industry has been limited because of difficulty in reaction scalability: 1) photochemical reactions are typically studied under batch conditions and are difficult to translate to flow, and 2) reactors cannot simply be scaled out because light penetration through a liquid medium decreases exponentially as the path length increases (Beer’s Law). The photoreactor designed in this work differs substantially in its approach in it is infinitely scalable in light penetration with <1 mm characteristic length without incurring hydrodynamic penalties typical in small channels. This ensures efficient photon transfer to the reactants. Wireless broad spectrum visible light LEDs (420 nm to 780 nm) were used as packing material inside the column of the reactor. Not only is the LED packing efficient at generating reactions, it also induces turbulence and mixing within the reactor. This is beneficial in multiphase chemistries. Alpha-terpinene, a precursor for the pharmaceutical ascaridole, was oxidized using air and a photosensitizer, Rose-Bengal.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGlobal energy demand has intensified as the economies and population of the world continue to expand. By 2050, an increase of at least 80% in energy demand has been estimated1. In other words, global energy security lies in the conservation of existing fossil fuel resources and the development of sustainable power sources, such as solar, wind, geothermal, fuel cell and hydrogen power systems. To replace fossil fuels, the advancement of alternative and sustainable energy resources, such as hydrogen, should be considered as a leading Net Zero technology option. Using hydrogen energy possesses the advantages of being renewable and environmentally friendly (no carbon dioxide emission during combustion). However, the storage and transportation of hydrogen are challenging. Hydrogen, a gas under ambient conditions, requires costly liquefication/compression procedures. Recently, a reversible hydrogenation-dehydrogenation cycle of hydrocarbons for hydrogen storage and delivery has attracted attention because it offers high hydrogen storage density, low cost, and recyclability. Researchers focus mainly on developing highly active metals for dehydrogenation2, which is a more complicated reaction. The supports also play a critical role in catalyst properties, especially the coke resistance.In the present work, platinum-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane to toluene were investigated at reaction temperature range of 200-400 °C. Different supports, such as titanium dioxide, yttrium oxide, and aluminum oxide, were explored to evaluate the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst. Coke formation on the spent catalyst was characterized using thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Furthermore, low-cost second metals (e.g., Nickel, Tin, Copper, and Zinc) as a promoter were also considered. The findings will be helpful in reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuels and further developing clean, hydrogen-based energy technologies.Reference1F. Wang et al.

    "abstract": "AbstractOrdinary Portland cement is produced using limestone, clay and sand. This process is energy intensive as it involves heating the raw material at high temperature and releases enormous amount of gas. Alternatively, industrial mineral waste (IMW) can be carbonated by using carbonate solution (e.g., Na2CO3). The carbonated IMW can be alkali activated to form Geopolymer which can fully replace Portland cement. In this carbonation step, the resultant liquid stream is mixture of NaOH (produced during carbonation) and Na2CO3. This NaOH is used to capture CO2from air to form Na2CO3which is reused for carbonation. This process uses aqueous carbonation cycle to capture CO2from the air at low cost while simultaneously upcycling industrial mineral wastes as cementitious materials by enhancing their pozzolanic reactivity. The resulting carbonated IMWs host the sequestered CO2in the form of solid carbonate (e.g., CaCO3). The major challenges in this process are feedstock variability and the long development cycles associated with the traditional trial-and-error concrete mixture design. In this work, we developed a continuous-flow membrane embedded microfluidic device to screen CO2capture efficiency. The process parameters and performance are predicted with this microfluidic reactor system that allowed the entire process cycle to be easily performed with small quantities of materials. Figure 1. shows a design of a membrane-embedded microfluidic reactor, which allow a continuous flow of liquid through a reaction chamber (4x4x2 mm) containing a fixed mass of alkaline waste (ash). The alkaline solution from the outlet of the microfluidic reactor is contacted with air in a microfluidic air contactor. A pH probe at the inlet and outlet of the air contactor was used to measure the variation in pH over time to assess the CO2capture efficiency. This setup also evaluated the effect of CO32-, unreacted OH-, and other cations on the carbonation rate.",

    "abstract": "AbstractParacetamol is one of the most widely used active pharmaceutical ingredients in the world. Supply shortages due to recent world events such as COVID-19 have demonstrated the reliance of many countries on paracetamol imports, increasing interest in the development of new green paracetamol synthesis routes to facilitate building new production centers.Current processes to produce paracetamol begin with petrochemical feedstocks. One way to improve the process is to use lignocellulosic material as a source of the required aromatic unit structures. To that end, the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol is a possible alternative to traditional synthesis methods because of the potential renewability of 4-nitrophenol (which may be obtained from lignin-derived phenol) as well as the relatively benign reaction conditions.Mechanochemical hydrogenation is an exciting Green method of conducting this reaction because of its elimination of the need for solvents as well as its ambient reaction conditions. Traditional hydrogenation processes are often operated in batch phase with solvents and high hydrogen pressures. Hydrogenation through ball milling offers superb mixing between the solid, liquid, and gas phases, often with little to no required solvent aids and atmospheric hydrogen pressures, because of the agitation and surface interactions provided by the physical movement in the reactor.We examine the mechanochemical transfer hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol under solvent-free and liquid-assisted conditions using various solid/liquid hydrogenating agents. We also explore a ball mill reactor setup allowing for solvent-free or liquid-assisted mechanochemical hydrogenation with hydrogen gas flow under ambient conditions with high yield. Next, we test a novel ball mill reactor setup with a gas bubbler allowing for simultaneous hydrogenation and acetylation with hydrogen gas and acetic anhydride vapor. Finally, we conduct a Green Chemistry analysis of each reaction for a quantitative examination of their viability.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe benefits of continuous manufacturing include greener and safer processes, better control over reaction conditions, and smaller, more agile systems.[1] Of particular focus is the rational implementation of process analytical technologies (PAT) to monitor and control the process. Online PAT enables the simultaneous monitoring of the system while providing a) robust response to changes and, b) capability to extract fast process information.The production of diphenhydramine, the most used antihistamine, primarily follows one of two batch processes in industry.[2] Therefore, it is an excellent target for process intensification via continuous flow synthesis.[3] It has been chosen as a model reaction in this work for showcasing the application of PAT to determine the kinetics of the synthesis reaction network, which has not been shown in the literature in the scenario of a nonpolar solvent. In this work, we evaluate low-field flow NMR for PAT applications and was employed in-line with a microfluidic system.Simulated reaction mixtures have yielded calibration NMR spectra. Figure 1a shows the spectra and calibration curve for chlorodiphenylmethane (DPC). The methane bridge hydrogen is chemically distinct allowing for further analysis and modelling. The DPC simple calibration model yielded an R2of 0.91 and for the DPH model 0.97. Efforts on PLS modelling are placed for the development of a more robust predictive model.The synthesis of DPH has been evaluated at various temperatures. We also conduct experiments varying initial concentrations of reaction mixtures to unravel the apparent order of the reaction which in turn is used for developing a kinetic model.

    "abstract": "AbstractIndustrially important liquid-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons with oxygen or air follows a free radical pathway that includes initiation, propagation, and termination. The main challenge of this process is to control product selectivity as the reactants are present in different phases, heat management due to exothermic reactions, and steps progress at different rates. This study highlights how engineering strategies can be used to manipulate various stages of the free radical process.Initiation is the first step of the free radical process, which is recognized as the slowest step and kinetically controlled. However, with the improved reactor technology, it was possible to change the initiation process. For instance, experiment demonstrated in a microfluidic reactor revealed that the initiation process can be significantly improved by controlling the gas-liquid interface (a), which ensures very high oxygen availability. Moreover, experiments performed in batch reactors showed that the rate of initiation was much higher in cases of higher gas-liquid interfacial area, followed by low interfacial area, and little or no initiation in circumstances of no gas-liquid interface.Propagation and termination steps are fast, and proper control of these steps would lead to the formation of desired products. Ensuring oxygen would lead to the oxygenates formation while oxygen deficiency would lead to addition product. A microfluidic reactor study maintaining Taylor flow revealed that ensuring oxygen availability increased ketone to alcohol conversion in primary oxidation products from 1:1 to 14:1 at nearly constant conversion. This selectivity increase was noticeably greater than in batch and semi-batch reactors. The size and shape of the microfluidic reactors have varied effects on mass transfer and mixing, which affect the conversion and selectivity in different ways.Overall, the controlled autoxidation method holds promise for turning lower-value hydrocarbons into value-added products, and engineering strategies can play a crucial role in controlling free radical chemistry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDue to their widespread application in a vast array of industrial processes, numerous kinetic mechanisms aiming to model the pyrolysis of light hydrocarbons have emerged in the literature. Because of the complexity of the phenomena involved, such mechanisms usually comprise hundreds to thousands of species and reactions and demand considerable CPU time. To reduce their computational cost and facilitate the coupling of these mechanisms with other phenomena, kinetic mechanism reduction methods can be applied. In this study, the reduction of a detailed kinetic mechanism used to model the pyrolysis of acetylene and the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) during low pressure gas carburizing (Bensabath et al., 2016) is presented. The reduction scheme adopted consists of two main stages (Table 1): (i) a reduction is first carried out with the ANSYS Chemkin Reaction Workbench by means of skeletal reduction methods and (ii) the skeletal mechanism obtained is further reduced by the lumping of species, radicals, and reactions of the same type. The accuracy of the mechanisms obtained is evaluated by comparing the predictions of molar fractions of major species like acetylene and hydrogen, as well as the total mass fraction of PAH, to the detailed model and to experimental data. The latter was obtained from acetylene pyrolysis experiments conducted in a tubular reactor at temperatures ranging from 850 to 1100 °C, pressures from 300 to 8000 Pa and residence times from 0.5 to 3 s. A very good agreement is observed between the predictions of all models and experimental results for acetylene and hydrogen (Figure 1). PAH formation, while accurately predicted by the original and skeletal mechanisms, is overestimated by the final mechanism, yet the results are encouraging. They will be improved in future works which will aim to adjust the kinetic data by the method of least squares.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe chemical industry accounts for ~5% of the US energy utilization and >30% of the US energy-derived industrial CO2emissions. Amongst these processes, the production of organic chemical commodities accounts for most of the energy utilization. The electrification of these processes via the implementation of electro-organic reactions could accelerate the decarbonization of the chemical industry. In this presentation, I will discuss how these reactions can help improve the sustainability of the production of one of the most important polymers in society, Nylon 6,6.The production of Nylon 6,6 involves the step-growth polymerization of 1,6-hexanediamine (HMDA) with adipidic acid. HMDA is currently produced by the hydrogenation of adiponitrile (ADN). The beginning of our journey starts by understanding and controlling the electrohydrodimerization of acrylonitrile (AN) to Adiponitrile (ADN). Our investigations on ADN are aimed at uncovering the relationship between the microenvironment at and near the electrical double layer (EDL) and reaction performance metrics. I will discuss general guidelines for electrolyte formulation and provide insights into the role of different electrolyte species in achieving conversions of AN to ADN with selectivity as high as 83%. Usingin situattenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate how supporting cations modulate the concentration of concentration species at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, and ultimately impact selectivity. I will also show how carefully controlling pulsed electrosynthesis conditions guided by active machine learning can help circumvent mass transport limitations, control the concentration of AN near the EDL and enhance the production rate of ADN. Our learnings on ADN electrosynthesis helped us to also engineer the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of ADN to HMDA, achieving the highest reported selectivity to date for this reaction (>95%). More recently, we have started to explore electrochemical routes to produce AN from glutamic acid, an abundant and inexpensive bio-based feedstock.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical CO2reduction (CO2R) provides a potential route to obtain a variety of carbon containing products. Here, we explore the use of a dilute ionic liquid (IL) solution in aprotic solvent. The use of an aprotic solvent allows us to avoid competition from HER due to a limited amount of easily ionizable protons that could be reduced while the IL could act as a cocatalyst to facilitate CO2activation. Pure ILs have also been used as electrolytes for CO2electroreduction in recent years. Ionic liquids have physicochemical properties which make them well suited as electrolytes, such as high intrinsic ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical potential windows, and high solubility of CO2. Almost all previous work on electrochemical CO2reduction in ILs has been done where CO2is simply physically dissolved in the IL. In this work, our selected set of ionic liquids react reversibly with CO2with an enthalpy of reaction that can be tuned over a very wide range by choice of electron donating or withdrawing groups on the anion. The ability to form anion-CO2carbamate complex could facilitate CO2activation and reduce the required potential for forming CO over Ag catalysts. Looking forward, combining the CO2capture ability of ILs with CO2R could produce systems that perform both functions in a single medium. Insights from this work will advance the performance of systems that perform simultaneous CO2capture and conversion. Furthermore, this work will show that in addition to modifying catalyst performance through active site engineering, electrocatalytic activity can be controlled by modifying the environment around active sites. The diversity of ILs provide a way to modify this environment, and thus catalyst performance, in a systematic way.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWaste activated sludge (WAS) is the solid residue obtained after solid-liquid separation in the primary, secondary, and tertiary wastewater treatment processes [1]. The production of waste activated sludge (WAS) from wastewater treatment processes is rapidly increasing. In 2011, global WAS generated was at 2 billion tons and a five-fold increase is expected by 2050 [2]. Disposal of WAS is mainly to landfills due to the energy and capital-intensive nature of other methods such as pyrolysis, gasification, and digestion.WAS contains a wide range of organic compounds as well as valuable nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen which can account for up to 4% and 9% of dry sludge, respectively [3]. The leachate from landfills can release these nutrients into the environment, raising environmental concerns. Therefore, recovering nutrients from WAS presents a significant opportunity towards a circular economy.Botte's group has been exploring novel electrochemical methods for nutrient recovery from sludge [4]. This presentation will focus on the group's advances in electrocatalysis using transition metal electrodes for nutrient recovery and the effects of parameters such as pH, temperature, and applied cell potential. Since sludge treatment accounts for a sizable portion i.e., 50 to 60% of wastewater treatment plant operational costs, WAS nutrient recovery could also provide economic benefits. This research highlights the potential for electrochemical approaches to address environmental concerns, improve resource efficiency and provide a sustainable solution for sludge management.[1] Fytili D, Zabaniotou A.

The scientific mission of BEES2 is to uncover transport mechanisms of ions, protons, redox species, and electrons in these nano-to-meso scale structured electrolytes in the bulk and at the electrode-electrolyte interface. In this talk, we will present the current understanding of how structure controls solvation dynamics, transport, potential-dependent surface behavior, and electron transfer kinetics in particular for CoHBEs, and further discuss how this understanding guides designing of molecular structures and engineering of flow cells. In relation to the latter, we developed active learning approaches and high throughput experimentation to advance these research efforts.

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical reaction engineering can be applied to many challenges needing to be addressed for a sustainable future – from where and how we get our fuels and chemicals to how we store and transport our energy. The chemical industry’s carbon emissions are largely from the combustion of fossil fuels for thermal heating of processes. As the renewable electricity contribution to the grid continues to grow and electricity prices continue to drop, electrochemically synthesizing chemicals becomes favorable.Electrochemical synthesis methods offer opportunities to perform reactions under benign reaction conditions (at or near room temperature and pressure), use less harmful or waste-generating reaction steps, and perform selective reactions. In electroreduction reactions, externally supplied hydrogen gas that is generally needed for reduction is not required. Rather, electrons, frequently paired with the electrolyte, are the reducing agents. An example ripe for electrochemical synthesis implementation is that of the biorefinery. The reduction of CO2to valuable fuels and chemicals can also be performed electrochemically and has promising results for synthesis of valuable chemicals and fuels.. Tuning electrochemical reactions requires not just the selection and design of good catalyst materials, it also requires tuning the electrolyte-electrode interface. Such interfacial engineering can be done by modifying electrolytes and/or the reactor cell design itself. Electricity utilization and energy storage go hand-in-hand and have many similar challenges. For example, electrolyte tuning in batteries is pivotal to generating stable electrolyte-electrode interfaces and their stable operation, especially when operated at extreme temperatures. In this work, lessons learned from kinetic analyses and electrolyte tuning in electrochemical reactions and energy storage will be presented.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPlastic waste accumulation is a global environmental issue, posing severe ramifications for the natural world. The current management of plastic waste is unsustainable, resulting in an estimated 79% of all plastic being disposed of in landfills, while only 9% is recycled. Plastic upcycling via hydrogenolysis is an attractive solution to redirect common polyolefin waste from the landfill and into value-added products such as lubricants. Ruthenium (Ru) supported catalysts are highly active for polyolefin hydrogenolysis. However, high catalyst activity and selectivity require high Ru loadings (>4 wt. %) and high catalyst/polymer ratios, increasing overall costs. Thus, this work aims to provide insights that will improve a fundamental understanding of structure-activity relationships governing catalytic behavior, as this is necessary for the development of tunable catalysts and can ultimately be leveraged to enable rational design.One of the objectives is to correlate particle size, structure, and metal support interactions (MSI) with product selectivity in polypropylene (PP) hydrogenolysis. Previous work in the field has shown that Ru’s performance is dependent on particle size with high activity for ultra-small clusters. MSI in reducible supports also play a key role in stabilizing small Ru clusters and creating active Ruδ+species but details regarding their impact remain unclear. Our work focuses on investigating Ru particle size effect on an inert carbon support utilizing various characterization methods including HRTEM, H2-TPR/TPD, XPS, NMR and GPC. Using an activated carbon support and systematic variation of Ru particle size (by changing Ru loadings and different pretreatment protocols), we reveal basic site requirements for PP hydrogenolysis and demonstrate the influence of small Ru nanoclusters on product selectivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe search for a solution to the growing accumulation of plastic waste remains a pressing challenge for society, in part due to the heterogeneous nature of the plastic waste stream. In particular, multilayer films (MF) contribute to this problem. MFs are complex, single-use plastics commonly used in food and medical applications, often comprised of several stacked thin-film polymeric components, such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH). Direct mechanical recycling of these complex MFs is infeasible. Subsequently, 2Mt of post-consumer MF waste is landfilled or incinerated annually. Alternative waste management strategies must be developed.Chemically deconstructing MFs into valuable chemicals is a promising method to reutilize this carbon resource. Although significant progress has been made for PE and PP deconstruction, EVOH has been largely ignored. Herein, we demonstrate catalytic hydroconversion for valorizing EVOH into high yields of liquid products (62%) at mild conditions and short processing time (2 h). We complete catalyst and process optimization to tune product selectivity, demonstrating control of both the molecular weight distribution and functionality of products. Extensive characterization of the catalyst was completed, including x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD); reaction products and remaining solid were also characterized to provide insights into structure-property relations. We establish a mechanistic framework for the hydroconversion of EVOH to explain the formation of liquid products. Moreover, key similarities and differences are identified between the hydroconversion of EVOH and polyolefins. These findings are utilized to design catalysts and reaction systems for the single-pot conversion of polymer mixtures and model MFs.",

Notably, this catalyst works effectively in natural seawater and demonstrates resilience across a broad range of temperatures and pH levels. Moreover, it shows high tolerance to various impurities and can facilitate closed-loop production of bottle-grade PET, offering an efficient solution to the global plastic waste crisis.

However, hydrogenolysis catalysts require expensive noble metals (i.e., Pt, Ru, Ir, etc.) to facilitate the reaction and are prone to producing low-value methane. Ni-based catalysts have been demonstrated to be earth-abundant metal alternatives to reduce the catalyst cost but they still suffer from significant methane production. Development of strategies to limit methane generation from polyethylene hydrogenolysis is a major obstacle to advancing polyolefin deconstruction. Herein, we have developed highly dispersed Ni catalysts. We demonstrate that controlled catalyst reduction is able to decrease the methane selectivity sevenfold (ca. 35% to < 5%). Catalyst characterization reveals the active site that influences the methane production and a structure-selectivity correlation.

    "abstract": "AbstractIn recent years, the rapid accumulation of plastic waste (e.g., polyolefins) in the environment, due in part to significant growth rate of plastic production, has resulted in global ecological concerns. Among different recycling technologies, chemical upcycling or conversion methods can serve as potential solutions to convert plastic waste into gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons that can be reutilized as fuels and chemical intermediates. Here, we performed solvent-free catalytic upcycling of PE to gaseous fuels (C3-C7) under mild conditions (473 K, 10 bar H2, 12 h) on metal-free and metal-loaded (1 wt. % either Pt or Ni) MFI zeolites to elucidate the respective contribution of metal and Brønsted acid sites for PE conversion. Further, these catalysts were compared to acid-free Pt and Ni supported on SiO2(M/SiO2), which would only exhibit hydrogenolysis activity; all samples were synthesized with similar nanoparticles sizes ((2.9-3.1) ± 1.6 nm) to minimize potential structure sensitivity and varied exposed metal surface area. Negligible solid conversions were measured on M/SiO2, indicating that hydrogenolysis activities of Pt and Ni are extremely low at these conditions. Interestingly, higher PE conversions were observed on metal-free than metal-loaded MFI (473 K, 10 bar H2, 12 h), which indicates that Brønsted acid sites alone are active for cleavage of C-C bonds in PE even at mild temperatures. The lower solid conversions observed on metal-loaded MFI zeolites are likely due to rapid hydrogenation of alkene species back to alkanes on metal sites that would otherwise be active for acid catalyzed beta-scission, hindering subsequent C-C bond cleavage events. These reactions mainly yield C3-C7hydrocarbons with trace amount of low-value methane and >C10products, likely related to the selectivity of medium pores in MFI toward smaller species. Taken together, these results showcase the possibility of utilizing zeolite-based hydrocracking catalysts for conversion of plastic waste to fuels.",

    "abstract": "AbstractC–C hydrogenolysis reactions, used in ring opening and chain shortening processes, provide an alternate method to chemically upcycle polyolefins, circumventing the difficulty in processing mixed waste streams and the quality loss associated with traditional mechanical recycling. Previous studies investigating the mechanism of C–C bond hydrogenolysis in linear alkanes have shown that the reaction proceeds through analogous partially dehydrogenated intermediates of the type RCCR’* in which both C atoms have lost two H each, regardless of chain length (J. Phys. Chem. (2019), p. 5421-5432; J. Phys. Chem. (2016), p. 8125-8138). While the rates of such reactions varied dramatically with chain length because of attractive dispersive interactions that favor activations in large alkanes; those activation mechanisms went unchanged. Studies on small, branched alkanes have shown that, counterintuitively, hydrogenolysis at C–C branches (having less H) proceed through reaction intermediates that are more extensively dehydrogenated. This excess dehydrogenation occurs at methyl groups vicinal to the cleaved bond (ACS Catal. (2016), p. 469-482) in isobutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane. To elucidate the mechanism of C–C bond hydrogenolysis at the branch points of polyolefins (i.e., far from chain ends), we study here the hydrogenolysis mechanisms of isobutane, 3-ethylpentane, and 4-propylheptane at low H2pressures using density functional theory (DFT) calculations on Ir(111), Pt(111), and Ru(001) surfaces. This study then determined how large a model compound needs to be to reliably predict the mechanism of the analogous reaction in an arbitrarily large molecule (i.e., can isobutane-derived results be extrapolated to 5-pentyl-nonane). In doing so, we have also examined other factors such as what species cover metal surfaces during polyolefin hydrogenolysis, and how ‘large’ transitions states can be penalized relative to ‘small’ transition states on those crowded surfaces. These results give insights into how polyolefin upcycling can be understood through model compound DFT studies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractChemical repurposing of plastics, especially polyolefins, has emerged as a promising route to valorize the “end-of-use” plastic waste and mitigate its environmental release. Hydrogenolysis with rare-earth metal catalysts, particularly Ru, has been shown to effectively depolymerize polyethylene (PE) waste. However, the selectivity towards valuable liquid-range products remains a challenge. In addition, utilizing earth-abundant metal catalysts is essential to ensure the sustainability of plastics valorization. Here we show the ability of silica-supported, earth-abundant cobalt (5 wt % Co/SiO2) catalysts to produce liquid-range products (C5-C30) with high selectivity, having tested from 200-300°C, 20-40 bar H2, and 2-32 h. At an optimized reaction condition of 275°C, 30 bar H2, and 8 h reaction time, 55% yield towards liquid products on a carbon-mole basis was achieved, which comprised 75% of non-solid products, with gas yields limited to ~19%. Furthermore, by tracking the product evolution, we infer a multi-pathway mechanism, including a dominant, non-terminal cleavage mechanism over the Co catalyst on the polymer chain, which drives the high liquid product selectivity. Lastly, we demonstrate the real-world viability of the catalyst, successfully applying it to various post-consumer polyethylene samples (HDPE jug, LDPE bag, and LDPE bottle) and demonstrating its effective recyclability and regenerability post-reaction. The catalyst remained active to polyethylene over 4 reactions, but the selectivity of reaction products shifted heavily towards liquids after the first reaction. After regenerating the catalyst in air at 450°C, selectivity shifted back towards high gas yields. We combined powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) of the post-reaction recycled and regenerated catalysts, finding that the cobalt phase shifted from fully oxidized Co3O4to CoO under reactions conditions, but that the shift in selectivity is likely due to coke formation. These results and insights move the field toward more sustainable and economically viable catalysts for chemical upcycling of waste plastics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPolymer upcycling by hydrogenolysis has gained attention for various hydrocarbon polymers resistant to other upcycling and chemical recycling approaches. Gas-phase C–C hydrogenolysis reactions have been extensively studied on H-covered Ir surfaces; however, these conditions are vastly different to polymer melt conditions during polymer upcycling. To determine the catalytic mechanisms related to polymer upcycling, we examined hydrogenations and hydrogenolysis reactions of a range of model compounds: benzene, toluene, butylbenzene, and 2,4-diphenylpentane. C–C hydrogenolysis studies of alkanes have shown that dehydrogenation elementary steps within the reaction are quasi-equilibrated, forming a pool of hydrocarbons with variable levels of saturation. Polyethylene alkanes can form aromatics, releasing H2available for hydrogenolysis reactions elsewhere in the backbone, and alternatively, aromatics in polystyrene can be hydrogenated in reactions competing with hydrogenolysis routes. Preliminary data for toluene hydrogenolysis on Ir(111) surfaces show that ring opening (endocyclic) mechanisms generally have lower free energy barriers than demethylating (exocyclic) mechanisms, which would result in branched products from the upcycling of polystyrene. The methyl substituent has a weak impact on the preferred ring opening location, with activation barriers generally favoring the formation of 2-methyl-hexane over heptane or 3-methylhexane. Toluene demethylation occurs through two low-energy barriers, one cleaving C6H5–CH* and the other cleaving C6H3–CH*. Preliminary data for hydrogenation steps forming cyclohexane from benzene indicate that hydrogenation barriers are lower than C-C cleavage activation barriers, but C-C cleavage activation barriers increase with increasing saturation of cyclic hydrocarbons. These data inform the catalytic mechanisms of ring opening and cyclization, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation and thus provide insights into polyolefin and polystyrene upcycling.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCO2reactive capture and conversion, e.g., CO2reduction reaction (CO2RR) into value-added hydrocarbons and alcohols, over organic-inorganic interface become a promising strategy to close the carbon loop and form a net-zero-carbon process. However, the mechanism of CO2RR to valuable hydrocarbons and alcohols at such structure-sensitive organic-inorganic interface is unclear under working conditions.To mitigate the above mechanism challenge, we designed an organic-inorganic interface, i.e., aminothioalte self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-modulated Cu interface (i.e., Cu-S-CnH2n-NH2, n = 2, 6, 11). Grand canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) simulation and mean-field microkinetic model are applied to prove that dual-active sites (organic nitrogen site (-NH2), inorganic Cu site) at the interface promoted CO2capture, first-proton transfer activation (i.e., COOH*formation), and its selectivity to C2(i.e., carbon-carbon (C-C) coupling). More specifically, our results (Figure 1) show that (1) the ligands prefer a flat-lying configuration at low coverage, while they favor upright configuration at high coverage due to the lateral interactions; (2) the ligands are stable over the Cu surface when the coverage is lower than ¼ ML. In addition, the ligand with a longer alkyl chain length is more stable; (3) aminothiolate ligands provide H bond and active N site to promote COOH*formation at Cu and N site, respectively, thus improving the activity; and (4) low coverage of aminothiolate ligand at flat-lying configuration decreases the activation barrier of C-C coupling up to 0.64 eV compared to that of bare Cu, facilitating the selectivity of C2species. The simulation results will be further validated with CO2RR experiments. Overall, this research provides an innovative picture of electrocatalysis at hybrid organic-inorganic interfaces, and specifically their roles in increasing catalytic activity and selectivity.ReferencesWan, M.; Gu, Z.; Che, F.,ChemCatChem2022,14, e202101224.Wan, M.; Gu, Z.; Shi, F.; Che, F.,Chem Catalysis2023.Under review.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTwo common approaches for CO2hydrogenation to long chain hydrocarbons (CO2-to-HCs) are modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methanol-mediated pathways, both of which combine multifunctional catalysts to achieve hydrocarbon (HC) synthesis via oxygenate intermediates, including CO and methanol (MeOH), respectively. The methanol-mediated pathway provides better controlled of the HC distribution in the product slates via methanol-to-hydrocarbon (MTH) chemistry by selecting the zeolite component and reaction conditions. An important challenge for further development of CO2-to-HCs processes via the methanol-mediated pathway is the mismatch between reaction conditions of MeOH synthesis and MTH, where MeOH synthesis is thermodynamically favorable at low temperatures and commonly performed in the 200 – 250 °C range, while higher temperatures (> 300 °C) are typically used for MTH reactions.In this study, hydrogenation of CO­2to HCs using a composite catalyst system in a single reactor under mild reaction conditions was investigated, by combining MeOH synthesis, MeOH dehydration and dimethyl ether homologation catalysts. This combination alleviates the mismatch in operating conditions of various reactions and provide opportunity to integrate these processes into a single reactor. High selectivity to isoparaffins, which are versatile precursors to sustainable aviation fuels, was achieved. The use of Cu/BEA significantly improved both the conversion of oxygenates and the HC yield compared to HBEA by facilitating H-incorporation in the C-chain growth during the homologation reaction. A study of catalyst composition and reaction conditions revealed that nearly complete conversion of oxygenates was achieved using a stacked-bed configuration, providing high C-selectivity to C4+HCs (34.1% among all products and 95.5% in products excluding CO). The ability to completely convert oxygenates to HCs and achieve high CO-free selectivity to desired HC products is unprecedented in CO2-to-HC reports, and advantageous for downstream separation, as CO can be easily separated and recycled to improve overall HC production in an integrated process.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSustainable CO2conversion is a promising strategy for carbon reduction and utilization as we push to reduce the atmospheric CO2concentration and limit global warming to 1.5 ºC. Replacing fossil fuels with CO2as a major feedstock for the chemical supply chain allows alcohols, plastics, fertilizers, and many other products that are integral to modern society to be produced with significantly reduced environmental impacts. Electrochemical CO2reduction (CO2R) has been widely studied as method for sustainable CO2valorization, but real-world implementation of electrochemical CO2R is limited by low selectivities for valuable multicarbon products and low production rates of complex products including oxygenates and aromatics. However, coupling electrocatalytic CO2R with a downstream thermocatalytic reaction that is compatible with a mixture of CO2R products enables the production of complex products with high selectivities, thus overcoming the limitations of direct electrochemical CO2R. In this work, we present a tandem reactor scheme wherein CO2is electrochemically reduced in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) to produce ethylene (C2H4), which subsequently undergoes thermocatalytic aromatization over a gallium- and phosphorus-modified ZSM-5 catalyst (Ga/ZSM-5/P) to produce a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers (BTEX). Several copper and copper oxide catalysts are assessed for their electrocatalytic performance in a 5 cm2MEA by measuring polarization curves and quantifying the product distributions using gas chromatography. We show that Cu is the optimal electrocatalyst, as it exhibits the highest C2H4selectivity and lowest absolute cell voltage of all the catalysts tested. The viability of the full tandem reactor system for CO2conversion to aromatics is then demonstrated by directly feeding the MEA output into a thermochemical flow reactor with Ga/ZSM-5/P (2 wt% Ga, 0.8 wt% P) at 650 ºC. Finally, we present a parametric study of electrocatalyst loadings, current densities, and CO2flow rates to optimize overall BTEX yield.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIntensified reactors for conversion of CO2to methanol (via hydrogenation) using metal oxide catalysts coupled with methanol conversion to aromatics in the presence of zeolites (e.g.: H-ZSM-5) in a single step have been introduced as a single step approach for chemical synthesis from CO2and H2. However, obtaining high selectivity to aromatics remains a challenge, with CO from the RWGS reaction and alkanes from olefin hydrogenation being significant co-products. To this end, we are interested in tuning the catalyst properties to favor aromatics production.Brønstedacid sites (BAS) in H-ZSM-5 are important sites in methanol aromatization reactions. Prior reports have evaluated the modification of acid sites in H-ZSM-5 to promote aromatization. However, the effect of isomorphous substitution has not been investigated in these tandem catalytic reactions. In this work, H-[Al/Ga/Fe]-ZSM-5 zeolites are synthesized with Si/T ratios = 80, 300, affecting acid site strength and distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites across these materials. These catalysts are combined in tandem with ZnO-ZrO2(methanol synthesis catalyst) for CO2hydrogenation, seeking to better understand the reactivity and improve aromatics selectivity. Of these zeolites, H-[Fe]-ZSM-5/ZnO-ZrO2gave the highest selectivity for aromatics at Si/Fe = 80 (~45%), with good aromatics selectivity even at Si/Fe = 300 (~36%).Interestingly, at Si/Fe = 300, the aromatization reactivity seems to be mainly controlled by Lewis acid sites, as evidenced by its competitive conversion rate despite no measurable zeolite Brønsted acid site density. To further study this family of zeolites, H-[Fe]-ZSM-5 materials over a broader range of different Si/Fe ratios are synthesized to further explore the compositional space. Under similar conditions, at Si/Fe = 160, H-[Fe]-ZSM-5/ZnO-ZrO2shows the highest selectivity for aromatics (~50%). Interestingly, there are no measurable BAS even at this Si/Fe ratio, implying the potential for extraframework Fe species being involved in the aromatization reaction pathways.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIt has long been understood that carbon capture, utilization, and storage/sequestration (CCUS) strategies have not typically been economically incentivized until recently with the introduction of carbon-tax schemes. Capitalizing on initiative, such as the Paris Agreement, towards achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 seem far-fetched without active market intervention and greener regulated policies. To that end, emerging CO2capture and conversion technologies into value-added products have seen continued advances through electrochemical and thermochemical routes. Herein, we discuss a targeted approach towards upgrading CO2with synergistic high tunability and scalability. Further, we demonstrate how minor refinement to the feed stream can result in the development of novel materials with CO2as feed.First, we adapt a thermochemical reduction technique that directly reduces CO2atop a catalytic Cu-based substrate into tunable quality reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through control of reaction humidity conditions, on-stream time, and morphology of catalytic substrate. Such operating parameters were found to have detrimental effects on rGO material properties including domain size, defect density, and degree of reduction (C/O ratio) to name a few. Second, we also give insight into different carbon nanomaterials (i.e., carbon nanotubes (CNTs)) that can be synthesized through rational modifications of this approach. Furthermore, we investigate a novel Cu-C-O material that was repeatably fabricated through direct reduction of CO2with H2O as a mild reducing agent. Work on identifying the novel Cu-C-O complex structures is still ongoing due to the intrinsic novel structure of the attained materials. Nevertheless, an array of characterization techniques including, but not limited to, FESEM, HRTEM, EDS, XPS, XRD, AFM, solid-state C-NMR, amongst others have been conducted on this novel material. Certain features point towards it being the first ever reported Cu-based MXene-like structure. Various characterization techniques towards identifying and elucidating the properties of this novel material will be discussed.",

Electrochemical CO2reduction (CO2R) towards valuable feedstocks has emerged as a promising approach to address the excessive concentration in atmosphere and thus help close the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Among various CO2R pathways, methanol production is relatively uncommon, and only a few catalysts have been able to achieve the conversion. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc), a well-known molecular catalyst, has been proved to be effective for CO2R towards methanol when immobilized on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). However, the selectivity of CO2R and CO reduction (COR) is demonstrated to be different.In this study, we systematically evaluated the COR/CO2R performance of CoPc@CNT in a flow cell under industrially relevant current densities. Our results showed that the faradaic efficiency of methanol in COR was about eight to ten times higher than that in CO2R. We then investigated the CoN4structure usingin-situX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and monitored different reaction intermediates viain-situattenuated total reflectance-surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS).Based on electrolysis experiments and mechanistic studies, we are able to reveal that the structure induced distinct selectivity of CO2R and COR for CoPc@CNT in the flow cell.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe direct conversion of CO2to C2+hydrocarbons through tandem catalysis presents a promising solution for mitigating CO2emissions while producing value-added hydrocarbons and fuels. Recent studies corroborate that ZnZrO in tandem with zeolite converts CO2to C2+hydrocarbons through CH3OH intermediate. However, the low conversion and selectivity to C2+hydrocarbons demand a further understanding of the catalytic process to allow improvements in catalyst design. Herein, the effect of the proximity of ZnZrO and zeolites (HZSM-5 and SAPO-34) to catalyst activity is investigated. We control the proximity of interaction between the ZnZrO and zeolite by different integration manners, e.g., dual-bed arrangement (millimeter scale spacing), granular mix (microscale), and mortar mix (nanoscale). The ZnZrO/HZSM-5 system shows the highest selectivity for C5+hydrocarbons (~40%) for granular mix while mortar mix exhibits the highest selectivity of short-chain paraffins (C2-C4) (~50%) at 400 °C. In the case of ZnZrO/SAPO-34, granular mix shows the highest selectivity for olefins (C2=-C4=) (~30%) while mortar mix exhibits the highest selectivity of short-chain paraffins (~80%). With microscale proximity, the chain length of end products is mostly affected by the pore size of zeolites. Interestingly, nanoscale proximity exhibits over-hydrogenation resulting in short-chain saturated hydrocarbons. Hence, we hypothesize that Zn sites could get ion-exchanged with protons of zeolite under reaction conditions. We investigate the ion-exchange effect of Zn2+by using granular mix of ZnZrO and Zn-ion-exchanged zeolite (Zn-ZSM-5 and Zn-SAPO-34) that results in high paraffin selectivity, similar to mortar mix. Characterization of the fresh and spent zeolites with ammonia and pyridine TPD reveal that Brønsted acid sites (BAS) decrease and Lewis acid sites (LAS) form in mortar mix. This LAS increase zeolite acidity causing over-hydrogenation of olefins. To conclude, proximity affects the hydrocarbon selectivity during CO2hydrogenation and migration of Zn2+ions occurs at nanoscale proximity resulting in over-hydrogenation of products.",

Despite decades of effort, no earth-abundant homogeneous catalysts have been discovered that can selectively catalyze the partial oxidation of methane to methanol. We have used our open source toolkit molSimplify to accelerate the discovery of candidate catalysts with machine learning. We exploit active learning to simultaneously optimize methane activation and methanol release calculated with machine learning (ML)-accelerated density functional theory (DFT) in a space of 16M candidate catalysts including novel macrocycles. In open shell transition metal catalysis, we show how conventionally used scaling relations are easily disrupted, motivating the development of independent ML models to predict multiple reaction energies that can be independently optimized. I will demonstrate how this approach accelerates the discovery of new design principles by at least a few orders of magnitude, leading to conclusions that are often unexpected. By constructing macrocycles from fragments inspired by synthesized compounds, we ensure synthetic realism in our computational searches. This large-scale search reveals that low-spin Fe(II) compounds paired with strong-field (e.g. P or S-coordinating) ligands and negatively charged axial ligands have among the best energetic tradeoffs between hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and methanol release needed for methane to methanol conversion. This observation contrasts with prior efforts that have focused on high-spin Fe(II) with weak-field ligands. Time permitting, I will also discuss our analysis of complexes that have been previously synthesized and their relation to our design principles from the active learning approach.",

Intermetallic compounds offer a promising avenue due to their precise local atomic composition and structure, which enables systematic manipulation of the arrangement of multiple metals in an active site. In this study, we present a computational workflow, integrated with experimental collaboration, to accelerate the discovery of intermetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions.We focus on the combination of inert hosts with active late transition metals and employ a range of computational approaches to identify intermetallic bulk and surface structures, automate adsorbate placement, and screen for surfaces with promising adsorbate/intermediate binding energies. Additionally, we introduce an automated transition state approach that enables us to identify and characterize the reaction mechanism for selective hydrogenation reactions.After rapidly detecting the most stable bulk structures over a composition space, all low-index facets of these bulk structures are enumerated to determine their active site nuclearities. Complex key adsorbates are placed on these low-index facets using an automated placement approach, generating a database of DFT adsorption energies. This database is used as a training set for machine learning approaches, allowing for the rapid expansion of adsorption energies to identify surfaces with targeted binding properties.Furthermore, we employ an automated transition state approach that enables the identification of the reaction mechanism for selective hydrogenation reactions on intermetallic surfaces. By analyzing the transition state structures, we can gain insight into the reaction pathway and identify active sites with optimal selectivity.Our computational workflow, shown inFigure 1, integrated with experimental collaboration and automated transition state analysis, provides a rapid and efficient approach for identifying intermetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions.

However, exploring the vast chemical space of materials and testing them experimentally is a challenging and time-consuming task. Therefore, the authors propose a high-throughput approach to explore untested materials with potential for ORR reactions, by combining computational simulations and experimental data.The authors focus on transition metal (M) antimonates (MSbOx) and aim to extrapolate the approach to other classes of materials. The methodology utilizes Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to extract electronic and structural descriptors from bulk crystal structures of materials. These descriptors are then combined with experimental ORR catalyst data and machine learning (ML) techniques to efficiently identify the most relevant factors that predict catalytic activity under relevant conditions. The authors have identified both experimental and theoretical descriptors and mechanisms to determine patterns of activity towards ORR. Mathematically simple and human interpretable models (rather than a black-box type approach) built over the descriptors, have been generated and simplified. Resulting models are straightforward and interpretable, and they have practical applications for transfer learning in predicting other active materials based on derived mathematical correlations.The authors’ approach can result in identification of new and promising catalysts with high ORR activity, and the methodology can be extended to include other materials such as sulfided (MSbSx) and nitrided antimonates (MSbNx) by incorporating universal electronic and structural descriptors. Similarities between extracted descriptors for M-O, M-N, and M-S would establish universality. The authors’ models have been benchmarked against standard ML methodologies and found to be accurate and transferable.

However, many of these properties can be easily computed from the ground-state electron density obtained via a density functional theory calculation. Thus, significant effort has also been spent in developing machine learning models that can predict electron density. Because it extends in three-dimensional space, electron density predictions require specialized model architectures which are more complex than models of scalar quantities such as energy. Models must also enforce desirable properties such as electron conservation and long-range decay. We present a graph neural network model that strictly retains these properties. We demonstrate the use of physics-based methods to calculate properties of heterogeneous catalysts and adsorbates directly from the model’s electron density predictions. Namely, we use Bader charge partitioning to predict partial charges and density functional theory to predict exchange-correlation and electrostatic energies. We briefly discuss challenges that remain in predicting other properties of interest such as atomic forces and total energy from electron densities.

However, similarly robust methods for larger cyclic hydrocarbons are lacking. Cyclic hydrocarbons are key intermediates during the dehydrogenation of liquid organic hydrogen carriers like methyl cyclohexane [1]. When adsorbed on bimetallic nanoparticles, cyclic hydrocarbons present a unique combinatorial challenge because of their diverse configurations across a wide-range of active site compositions. We present a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model that predicts the adsorption energy of toluene on bimetallic Pt cuboctahedra nanoclusters containing 55 atoms. This probe system was selected because the adsorption energy of toluene serves as a descriptor for the dehydrogenation of methyl cyclohexane. The composition space included random alloys of Pt with d-block elements. Using density functional theory (DFT), we calculated the adsorption energies of toluene on 125 active sites spanning a range of coordination numbers and compositions. GPR was selected due to its ability to develop robust models with small datasets and its inherent uncertainty quantification capabilities. Our feature set included the composition, electronegativity, and cohesive energy of metals atoms in the active site and the first-nearest neighbors. An 80-20 train-test split was employed.Figure (a)indicates that GPR predicts the adsorption energy of toluene across various compositions of nanoalloys with errors of 0.12 eV (test set).Figure (b)shows that trends in adsorption energies with increasing hetero-metal composition are consistent with DFT calculations. By including features related to the adsorbate structure, our model is extended to other intermediates within the methyl cyclohexane dehydrogenation network. This study highlights the power of GPR in predicting adsorption energies of cyclic hydrocarbons on bimetallic nanoclusters, thereby opening avenues for designing tailored nanoparticle catalysts.[1] Okada Y., Extended abstracts of the 9th Tokyo Conference on Advanced Catalytic Science and Technology, Fukuoka, KL14, (2022).",

Recalibration of model uncertainties is shown to be essential in practical screening applications of catalysts using uncertainties.Fig. 1.Advanced materials discovery strategies are enabled with uncertainty quantification.

    "abstract": "AbstractBipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED) is a sustainable and highly tuneable electrocatalytic technology used to efficiently manipulate the pH of liquid streams through electrosynthesis of H+ and OH- ions from water. The salient benefits of BPMED arise from its fundamental design; it consumes electricity alone to correct stream pH, resulting in greater sustainability and tunability. However, current barriers to implementation of BPMED stem from a high energy consumption resulting from a high membrane electrical resistance or a low selectivity.In this work, a novel circuit-based model of a BPMED reactor has been developed to evaluate trouble areas and optimise design. The repeating unit cell is represented as a system of resistors in series, with membranes and electrolytes comprising the resistive elements. The water splitting potential is computed using Wein’s second law, Ohm’s law is used to relate the cell voltage to a current density on a differential volume, and Faraday’s law translates the current density to an ion flux. Ion speciation is computed in these differential volumes as well. Delayed differential material balances are then used to calculate the distribution of ionic species in time and space. A critical feature is a novel model for the current efficiency, calculated as a function of the trans-membrane concentration difference rather than assumed constant. Experimental validation was conducted on a PC Cell BED 1-4 recirculating batch system and showed good agreement across a range of conditions and variables.This model was integrated into an Aspen Plus model to simulate and optimise the electrosynthesis of concentrated NaOH and HCl from seawater. The compact nature of BPMED and reliance on electricity only makes this a promising application for offshore platforms.

To address this, we present a two-dimensional model of BPMED for CO2 capture solvent recovery in COMSOL Multiphysics. The Navier-Stokes and continuity equations were implemented to compute a convection field, and the ionic species transport calculated through Nernst-Planck equation with an electroneutrality condition. A concentration source term accounted for ionic speciation and water splitting reactions, captured through kinetic rate expressions and the second Wein effect. Experimental validation conducted on a PC Cell BED 1-4 recirculating batch system demonstrated good agreement between the model and experimental results across a range of conditions and variables.The calculated concentration profiles revealed that the majority of the speciation reaction takes place inside or directly adjacent to the bipolar membrane. Crucially, this includes the conditions necessary for bubble nucleation. Bubbles consequently form inside membrane pores, displacing the electrolyte and greatly increasing the electrical resistance of the membrane. However, the location of the reaction plane where bubbles are generated can be manipulated by increasing the channel width or reducing the applied voltage. The strength of this model has therefore been demonstrated to identify and explore engineering challenges in BPMED. Future research will focus on expanding to multiphase CFD simulations to investigate the coupled effect on flow.",

Despite significant advancements in catalyst materials and electrolyzer optimization, translating this progress into practical applications is challenging due to the system's complex multiphase and multiscale nature, particularly under industrially relevant conditions. Accounting for uncertainties in the physical system is crucial to develop more accurate models, ranging from estimating kinetic parameters to biases in transport parameters. In this study, we perform uncertainty quantification of an electrochemical cell model validated against experimental data. We explore the uncertainties associated with the input model parameters and compare them with the experimental measurements, assessing the reliability of the model predictions. Our analysis also sheds light on the contribution of different parameters to the variation in current density predictions, which can help build confidence in the model. By quantifying the biases and uncertainties in model parameters, we can develop more accurate models, which could accelerate the translation of the electrochemical reduction of CO2into practical applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) is a promising approach for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals using renewable electricity. Significant progress has been made over the past decade both from a modeling and experimental standpoint on understanding how several factors including the electrode material, electrolyte pH, CO2 availability and mass transport affect the reaction rate and efficiency for eCO2R. However, we are still faced with a number of challenges that have to be overcome to enable commercialization of CO2 electrolyzers.[1] In this regard, resolving the reaction environment at the vicinity of the electrode can provide crucial insights into the reaction mechanism and key parameters that control the electrolyzer performance.[2,3] In this work, we present a multi-scale approach that couples ab-initio microkinetic simulations to continuum transport models to understand eCO2R on Au in a flow reactor configuration. We find the simulated CO2 concentrations, pH, the current density towards CO and the Tafel slopes all strongly depend on both the applied potential and the spatial distance along the electrode. We further analyze the implications of the spatial distribution of these parameters and provide strategies to improve CO2utilization and the overall electrolyzer performance. Our work highlights the need to develop multidimensional, multiscale modeling approaches to capture the full complexity of the reaction environment at the vicinity of the electrode and obtain detailed understanding of eCO2R.This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. DOE by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) under contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.References:[1] I.

    "abstract": "AbstractLow temperature (LT) water electrolysis (2 H2O → 2 H2+ O2) is a promising route to sustainable H2production. While contemporary LT membrane electrolyzers rely on ultrapure water, the direct electrolysis of impure water sources would offer an attractive set of advantages, including reduced complexity associated with water purification infrastructure as well as a larger pool of available feedstocks. However, impure water electrolysis introduces distinct challenges. Among them, ionic Cl-impurities can lead to Cl-oxidation to corrosive ‘free chlorine’ species (e.g., OCl-, HOCl, Cl2), and the transport of impurity ions can drive the formation of deleterious pH gradients.Herein, we have evaluated a bipolar membrane (BPM)-based electrolyzer architecture for H2production from impure water streams. We aimed to leverage the BPM architecture to inhibit undesired ion transport and to promote an alkaline anode/electrolyte interface that would minimize the rate of Cl-oxidation with respect to a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. We assessed the role that electrolyzer architecture plays in dictating four metrics: ion transport, Cl-oxidation selectivity, long-term electrolyzer stability, and energy efficiency. Using an asymmetric saline solution (0.5 M NaCl) or ‘real’ seawater to the cathode, we observed nearly undetectable levels of free chlorine in the BPM; conversely, significant concentrations of ‘free chlorine’ species were observed in the PEM anolyte feed. Cl-transport accounted for less than 1% of total current across both the BPM and PEM devices at 250 mA cm-2, and cation transport across the devices was also limited. The limited Cl-crossover from cathode to anode and low chlorine oxidation rates were correlated with stable operation over extended operation at 250 mA cm-2, suggesting that inherently salt- and impurity-tolerant BPMs offer a promising route toward seawater electrolysis[1].[1] Marin, Perryman, Boettcher*, Nielander*, Jaramillo*, et al.,Joule, 2023",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical CO2reduction (CO2R) on Cu enables the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals, though often with non-ideal selectivity. Mass transport plays a key role in the product selectivity and activity by controlling the local microenvironment and availability of reactants. Attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) enables the selective study of the microenvironment within 10 nm of a nanostructured metal thin film. For CO2R on nanostructured Cu thin films, ATR-SEIRAS provides measurements of the local CO2concentration, relative coverage of *CO, and local pH via the measured concentrations of HCO3-and CO32-. We have developed a flow reactor (Figure A) capable ofoperandoATR-SEIRAS, where reaction products can be quantified concurrently with spectroscopic measurements. The flow reactor utilizes impinging electrolyte jets for well-defined and tunable mass transport, with flow rates of 10-100 mL/min providing a 5x difference in the effective boundary layer thickness.Using ATR-SEIRAS, we detect the CO2concentration and pH at the catalyst-electrolyte interface,finding significantvariation from their bulk values (Figure B). The CO2concentration can decrease by a factor of 3 or more and the pH can increase by 3 or more units. The differences in local pH and CO2concentration from the bulk are highly dependent on the flow rate, as the flow controls the rate at which CO2and HCO3-are replenished and basic species are carried away. Our work also elucidates the effect of flow rate on reaction selectivity, such as the observed increased production of CO relative to C2H4on Cu foil at higher flow rates. These relationships between flow rate and selectivity are rationalized based on the observed microenvironment changes. The application of surface-sensitive spectroscopy to a CO2R reactor with well-defined and tunable flow illuminates the significant impact of mass transport and catalyst microenvironment on CO2R device performance.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe realization of technologies to electrify catalytic processes of transforming small molecules such as CO2, CO, NO3-/NO2-, and H2O into value-added products necessitates the development of practical reaction-transport kinetics that can be used for scale-up and operation of electrolyzers. The first step to the development of such kinetic expressions is the recognition that what we measure is reactor kinetics, not intrinsic kinetics. Decoupling the effect of mass transport on observed reactor kinetics and revealing true surface kinetics is enabled by interpreting a large experimental dataset obtained under a broad range of well-defined transport characteristics in the gastight rotating cylinder electrode reactor. In this talk, we present the reaction-transport kinetics model for electrochemical CO2reduction on copper developed based on the continuously-stirred tank reactor approximation of the reaction front at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Dimensionless Sherwood and Damköhler numbers are incorporated in the model to represent transport characteristics of supplying reactants to the reaction front and the residence time of intermediates generated on the electrode surface. Using the same reaction-transport kinetics obtained from electropolished copper, we have further investigated the effect of internal pore diffusion on the electrochemical CO2and NO3-reduction on nanoporous copper. Simulated effectiveness factor for pore utilization of reactants and intermediates under different Thiele modulus explains changes in observed reactor kinetics when catalysts with the same surface kinetics but of different porosity are used. Analogous to thermal catalysis, observed Tafel slopes can change dramatically under different mass transfer resistance regimes. Therefore, reaction kinetics should incorporate transport effects in electrocatalysis where the concept of the differential reactor is not readily available. Both the models discussed in this talk, capturing the effects of convective mass transfer and internal pore diffusion, show why the Tafel analysis fails to describe complicated reactions involving intermediates and multiple products.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R), which uses renewable electricity to power the conversion of abundant feedstocks (i.e.,water, air, and CO2) to value-added products, present a promising pathway to decarbonize the manufacturing of various chemical commodities. Unfortunately, these devices are challenged by poor efficiency and selectivity when operating at industrially relevant rates. Continuum modeling enables the simulation of transport and catalysis in these systems to resolve the effects of mass transfer and the local catalyst microenvironment on reaction kinetics. Accordingly, recent advances in multi-scale modeling have resolved variations in species activities and fluxes from the mesoscale (e.g.,the mass transport boundary layer) to the nanoscale (e.g.,the electrical double layer) to better understand and optimize selectivity in CO2R systems. Unfortunately, many recent models are not well validated to experimental data, and there has yet to be a model capable of both reproducing partial current density experimental data and rationalizing experimentally observed reaction phenomena such as the effect of the electrolyte cation on CO2R activity.In this talk, I will explore how continuum modeling can be used to understand the performance of CO2electrolyzers. I will discuss our group’s efforts to determine how mass transport and double layer structure dictate activity and selectivity in CO2R. We couple the developed model with covariance matrix adaptation to extract kinetic parameters that match experimentally observed partial current densities of CO2R over an Ag catalyst with quantified uncertainty. This analysis demonstrates the extent to which mass transport impacts observed kinetic parameters. Through careful development of a multi-scale model, transport to the catalytic active site in electrochemical CO2R is described and unexplained phenomena, such as the effect of electrolyte cations, can be rationalized. While applied here for electrochemical CO2R, the developed techniques are relevant for all electrochemical reactions where an understanding of transport processes is critical.",

The further catalytic hydrogenation of benzoic acid into aromatic products such as benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, and toluene is largely desired due to their versatility as commodity chemicals and intermediates. Single-atom late transition metal catalysts supported on reducible metal oxides such as anatase TiO2are promising candidates due to their performance in similar types of reactions. However, compared to well-studied hydrogenation processes on extended late transition metals, mechanisms of C-H bond formation directly on reducible metal oxide support sites remain an open area of research.Density functional theory calculations are used to elucidate plausible chemoselective C-H bond formation mechanisms on anatase TiO2. A microkinetic model was constructed using computed reaction energies and activation barriers to predict the performance of TiO2-supported catalysts under reaction conditions. We demonstrate that competing hydrogenation mechanisms and electronic effects from the support largely dictate the relative selectivity of hydrogenation products. We also show that favorable mechanisms of C-H bond formation are consistently mediated by hydrides present on reduced surface sites. Finally, we use our microkinetic model to predict which elementary mechanisms are rate-determining and we propose rational design principles from our results that can maximize the performance of similar systems.(1) Diaz-Silvarrey, L.S. et al.,Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis,134(2018) 621-631.",

While current market prices of petroleum-derived DVL are very high due to poor availability of C5 feedstock in petroleum, lignocellulosic biomass is rich in pentoses that can be catalytically upgraded to fine chemicals like furfural.Herein, we demonstrate our patented route to DVL from dehydrogenation of furfural-derived 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran (HTHP) over Cu catalysts. However, HTHP is a cyclic hemiacetal that undergoes 3 other competing reactions during dehydrogenation to DVL, including: 1) Dehydration to 3,4-dihydropyran (DHP), 2) Dimerization to 2,2’-hydroxytetrahydropyran, and 3) Hydrogenation to 1,5-pentanediol (PDO) from H2generatedin situ(Scheme 1). Since the thermochemistry of HTHP and its dimers is not available in existing databases, we have carried out DFT calculations at the level of theory: M06-2X/jun-cc-pVQZ//M06-2X/cc-pVTZ. DFT has shown that the ΔGrxnof both DVL and DHP production decrease with increasing temperatures, with DVL being the most exergonic reaction at T>150°C and all other reactions being endergonic. Kinetic experiments carried out over Cu/SiO2catalysts show that the highest observed selectivity to DVL is 70% at 150°C. Products have been analyzed using temperature-variable NMR, GC, and HPLC, depending on the product phase. DVL production has an apparent activation energy of 10.3 kJ mol-1and is half-order with respect to HTHP partial pressure. We have also determined the reaction parameters of all competing reactions involved and developed a complex kinetic model for the system to optimize selectivity to DVL as a function of temperature, feed composition and HTHP conversion.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe selective oxidation of propylene to acrolein (ACO) and acrylic acid (ACOOH) are conventionally carried out under steady state conditions in fixed-bed or fluidized-bed reactors on bismuth-molybdate based catalyst. It is thought that the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism governs the selective oxidation to ACO or ACOOH; specifically, in the absence of gas phase oxygen, propylene reacts with nucleophilic lattice oxygen. Decoupling the oxidation and reduction stages of the catalyst hence has the potential to improve (ACO and ACOOH) selectivity. In this study, we evaluate forced dynamic operation of a laboratory fixed-bed reactor to identify conditions of ACO and/or ACOOH selectivity/yield enhancement over steady state operation.The effluent ACO concentration of an FDO and a steady state operation (SSO) with the same reductant to oxidant ratio (ROR) is shown in Figure 2. Because SSO receives more oxygen (11.7% O2) than FDO does in its primary cycle (5%) at first, its ACO yield is greater than FDO's. With time, however, sustained cyclic operation outperforms the SSO (17% ACO yield in FDO compared to 12% in SSO). Moreover, prolonged FDO had better ACO selectivity than SSO (54% in FDO vs. 41% in SSO). The catalyst's initial high activity is caused by an increase in the amount of oxygen stored there during pretreatment. The amount of oxygen the catalyst has available to convert propylene into acrolein steadily decreases as the catalyst's re-oxidation occurs more slowly than its reduction. By adding more oxygen for a longer period during the secondary re-oxidation cycle of the FDO, the initial high activity of the catalyst can be maintained, which is demonstrated in Figure 3. When catalyst oxidation is rate-limited at low temperatures (below 370 °C), changing the feed composition by re-oxidizing the catalyst without the reductant improves acrolein selectivity and yield in comparison to traditional steady state operation.",

Thus, a combination of automated and manual approaches is required. In our first efforts toward this goal, a detailed kinetic model for combustion ofn-pentane, the smallest relevant paraffin for this application, was generated using the open-source Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) software. Mechanism generation was tested with and without input from available libraries of thermochemical properties and rate parameters. In addition, some well-justified modifications to rate parameters of several key reactions were made based on comprehensive reaction path and sensitivity analyses to improve model performance. We then built upon this model, and the lessons learned in generating it, to produce compact kinetic mechanisms forn-hexadecane combustion, including by using then-pentane mechanism as a seed mechanism for generating then-hexane combustion mechanism. This talk will present ignition delay time predictions for bothn-pentane andn-hexadecane across a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios. We will also discuss lessons learned and the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to creating compact yet useful mechanisms for large alkane combustion. Highly simplified models for the high temperature and high-pressure regime were also generated and tested for alkanes up to C20H42.

    "abstract": "AbstractAs one of the C1 chemistry reactions which play a critical role in the chemical and energy industry, oxidative carbonylation of alcohols to corresponding dialkyl carbonates (DACs) has been studied due to DACs’ myriad applications, such as aprotic solvents, alkylation reagents, alkoxycarbonylation reagents, solvents for Li-ion batteries, monomers for polycarbonates, and gasoline additives.Conventionally, DACs have been produced via the phosgenation of corresponding alcohols. Although this process is simple and low cost, it causes harmful effects to the environment due to using the lethal phosgene and generation of corrosive HCl as a by-product. Therefore, several alternative approaches have been developed, and oxidative carbonylation of alcohols is considered as the most feasible reaction owing to high atomic efficacy. Meanwhile, EniChem has commercialized dimethyl carbonate (DMC) production via Cu salt-catalyzed oxidative carbonylation since the early of 1980s, but this process suffers from low activity and high corrosion due to its halide content.To overcome these issues, Se-based catalysts have been investigated due to the generation of SeCO which easily reacts with nucleophiles. However, they are still limited by the low yield of DACs. Thus, we studied Se/tertiary amine catalytic system for oxidative carbonylation of 2-methoxyethanol (MEG). Notably, Se/DMAP catalytic system for oxidative carbonylation of MEG afforded bis(2-methoxyethyl) carbonate (BMEC) with 60.9% yield at 50 °C. This catalytic system highlights higher turnover frequency (TOF) values under milder conditions than any other previous catalytic system. To unravel the role of DMAP and suggest a plausible mechanism of Se/DMAP-catalyzed oxidative carbonylation,1H NMR, in situ or ex situ ATR-FTIR, and DFT calculations were studied. Throughout these studies we could identify the key DMAP intermediate resulting from DMAP-mediated esterification and revealed that DMAP exhibits a unique triple functionality, acting as a base, a hydrogen bond (HB) acceptor, and a nucleophile.",

These OH radical are transported to the surrounding solution where they drive reactions with organic substrates, thus presenting a promising strategy for radical-mediated chemical synthesis using only water, electricity, and apiezoelectricmaterial. Products from gas-phase reactions of OH radicals with benzyl alcohol in the presence of O2(e.g. glyoxal, butenedial, hydroxymethylphenol isomers) were shown to form during ultrasonic irradiation of aqueous benzyl alcohol.A network of reaction steps based on established radical reaction steps (Fig. 1a and 1c) is proposed to account for distributions of products formed from OH-benzyl alcohol reactions. The reaction energies and activation barriers for these reaction stepswere calculated using density-functional theory (DFT) methods and standard statistical mechanism formalisms. Kinetic parameters based on these calculations successfully captured directional trends for dependences of product selectivity on O2pressure (Fig. 1b). Increased O2activity drives O2addition to cyclic intermediates forming bicyclic compounds that ultimately fragment to glyoxal and 3-hydroxy-2-oxo-propanal; these dicarbonyl products further oxidize to oxalic acid (Fig. 1c). The computational and experimental results reveal that sonication drives reactions of aqueous aromatic compounds via mechanisms analogous to those established in atmospheric chemistry. In doing so, we show that atmospheric chemistry can be harnessed in ultrasound reactors thus inspiring future applications of sono-chemical synthesis.Figure 1:(a) Steps for benzyl alcohol-OH reactions with O2.

Our initial work was focused on Pt which sinters when heated in air due to formation of volatile PtO2. Trapping the Pt ions in ceria, a process we termed atom trapping [1], allows atomically dispersed Pt to be stable at 800 °C in air, achieving the goal of creating a thermally stable single atom catalyst. However, the ability of ceria to stabilize Pt ions is limited to specific sites on the surface of the oxide support. Here we show that PdO can trap Pt ions at much higher concentrations because Pt ions can be accommodated into the PdO lattice forming a solid solution. When heated in air to 800 °C, we find that biphasic particles are formed where the oxide phase is conjoined to the metal, in apparent thermodynamic equilibrium [2]. This composite biphasic particle represents a prototypical self-healing catalyst where the Pd oxide can trap Pt ions and recycle them to the metallic phase. We will show how atom trapping is critical to understanding how Pd helps to stabilize Pt in diesel oxidation catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInverse oxide/metal catalysts have shown to be excellent systems for studying the role of the oxide and the oxide-metal interface in a catalytic reaction. In recent studies, it has become clear that these systems can have especial catalytic properties due to strong oxide metal interactions difficult to obtain when depositing a metal on a regular oxide support. As a consequence of these strong interactions, oxide phases which are not seen or are metastable in a bulk oxide become stable in an oxide/metal system opening the possibility for new chemical properties. Using these systems it has been possible to explore in detail correlations between the structural, electronic and catalytic properties of oxide-metal interfaces and obtain a fundamental understanding of factors which determine catalytic performance in reactions such as the water-gas shift, the hydrogenation of CO2to methanol and the conversion of CH4 to high value chemicals. This talk will discuss the behavior of active and selective oxide/metal catalysts for these processes.",

While many of these catalysts exhibit superior specific activities and selectivities, stabilization of the metal as isolated atoms remains a challenge. We have recently explored the stabilization of Pt and Rh atoms in nests of 4-6 atoms of Sn, Zn, Fe, and Co created by grafting a precursor of these elements into silanol nests created by the dealumination of BEA zeolite (DeAlBEA). This talk will discuss the preparation and characterization of Pt dispersed on DeAlBEA containing Sn, Zn, and Fe, and will illustrate the challenges of ascertaining the state of Pt dispersion by means of IR adsorption of CO, EXAFS, and HAADF-STEM. The effects of the anchoring element on the activity, selectivity, and stability of Pt for the dehydrogenation of propane and butane will then be examined along with the effects of these elements on the reaction kinetics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn the search for more active, stable and selective catalysts, materials such as alloys have emerged as highly promising. Single atom alloys constitute a special type of such materials, synthesized by combining a host metal with a dopant metal at such high dilutions that the dopant remains atomically dispersed. The dopant atoms therein are subject to electronic and geometric effects, giving rise to catalytic sites with unique properties, not exhibited by either component of the alloy in a pure state. This behavior generates novel opportunities for designing catalysts for industrially relevant chemistries, such as hydrogenation reactions or alkane activation. A fundamental understanding of the properties of SAAs would be indispensable in formulating principles that would aid catalyst design efforts. Motivated by these opportunities, we have studied in the past decade SAAs in detail and have revealed their reactivity trends and their ability to escape traditional Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relations, thereby providing opportunities for designing superior catalysts. Highlights from this research will be presented and discussed, along with our latest efforts in building a general theory of SAA reactivity, based on analyzing the physics and chemistry of the interactions between SAA sites and species adsorbed thereon.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAs of 2018, only 8.7% of all the plastics produced are recycled; the rest are landfilled, incinerated, or leaked into the environment. Chemical upgrading provides a potentially attractive pathway to valorize waste plastics and promote a carbon-circular economy. Polyolefins are the most abundantly used plastics. However, the conversion of polyolefins is hindered by their high thermal stability and the hydrocarbon products with a widely distributed molecular range. The pyrolysis oil of polyolefins often contains significant amounts of waxes (>C20 hydrocarbons, solids at room temperature). Due to their high boiling points, the waxes in pyrolysis oil can cause reactor clogging and increase the reactor temperatures during catalytic upgrading. In our work, we overcome this challenge by preheating polyolefins before pyrolysis. The preheating temperatures were determined for different polyolefins based on their respective physiochemical behavior at the molten phases. At the optimal preheating temperatures, the chain fragmentation overruled the crosslinking reactions, and the viscosities of the molten plastics also reached the lowest. It shows that pyrolysis of preheated polyolefins can produce hydrocarbons with significantly narrower molecular weight distribution, decreasing wax contents without affecting gas products. As a result, more gasoline and diesel range hydrocarbons could be produced. When raw HDPE and the HDPE preheated at 295 ℃ were pyrolyzed, the wax yields reduced from 49 to 34 C% and 41 to 25 C%, respectively, for the pyrolysis temperatures of 550 and 600 °C. Notably, the respective gas yields only increased from 3.9 to 4.5 C% and 5.7 to 7.3 C%. Similar results were also obtained with a preheated LDPE. Catalytic pyrolysis of the raw and preheated HDPE was also compared. It shows that the selectivity of alkylated single-ring aromatics increased with the preheated HDPE.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe widespread use of plastic has led to major environmental pollution issues. The non-degradability, lack of recyclability, and extended lifespan of plastic have made them a significant source of environmental pollution. Pyrolysis-based recovery of fuels and chemicals from plastic waste is a promising and innovative method for both waste management and energy conservation. However, conventional pyrolysis suffers from high energy input equivalent GHG emissions, poor product selectivity, and low value of the final products. This work focused on investigating microwave catalysis technology to upcycle plastic waste at low temperatures. Zeolites (ZSM-5 and Y) supported catalysts have been developed for plastic microwave catalytic upcycling to produce light olefins and aromatics. The reactions were conducted in a Sairem microwave system, which is equipped with a 2.45 GHz solid state generator and 900W maximum forward power. At 300°C reaction temperature, the conversion of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is greater than 95% over all catalysts. The High BTX (Benzene, Toluene and Xylene) selectively was obtained over Ni/ZSM-5 (23.2 wt.%) and Ru/ZSM-5 (22.9 wt.%). While the high selectivity of light olefins was observed over Ga/ZSM-5 (52 wt.%) and Fe/ZSM-5 (42.7 wt.%). The study demonstrates a promising method for upcycling plastic wastes to valuable monomers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWaste plastics are an abundant feedstock to produce renewable chemicals. Pyrolysis of waste plastics produces pyrolysis oils with high concentrations of olefins (>50 wt.%) which are the central building blocks of the chemical and polymer industry. The traditional petrochemical industry uses several energy-intensive steps to produce olefins from fossil feedstocks such as naphtha, natural gas and crude oil. It would be highly desirable to take advantage of the olefins in the plastic pyrolysis oil and produce value-added chemicals.In this work, we demonstrate the conversion of post-consumer plastic wastes into high value chemicals using pyrolysis and hydroformylation. Hydroformylation of plastic pyrolysis oils produces aldehydes. These aldehydes can then be reduced to mono- and di-alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts. The feedstocks and the upgraded oils were characterized by the combination of two-dimensional (2D) Gas Chromatograph (GC×GC), one-dimensional (1D)/2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), as well as the Elemental CHNOS analysis. This route produces high-value ($1,500-5,000/ton) oxygenated chemicals from low-value post-consumer recycled polyethylene ($100/ton). The chemicals produced have 60% lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to their production via petroleum feedstocks.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogenolysis of waste polyolefins is a promising method for the conversion of polyolefin waste into valuable chemicals. In this work, we used techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the economic viability and environmental sustainability of a conceptual process design for polyolefin hydrogenolysis. The TEA results indicate a minimum selling price of selected key products, liquid alkanes and propane, to be 1.5-3.5 times and 1.7 times that of virgin manufacturing, respectively. This work also explores the potential of blending the liquid alkane product with refinery streams to provide economic and environmental benefits. Additionally, the potential of closing the loop in the plastics economy via the conversion of propane to propylene monomer was assessed using a commercial propane dehydrogenation process, which resulted in a minimum selling price equivalent to that of virgin monomer. LCA analysis showed that the hydrogenolysis process has a lower environmental footprint compared to incumbent manufacturing. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis identified feedstock cost, hydrogen supply, and operating cost as the primary cost drivers. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive assessment of the conceptual process for polyolefin hydrogenolysis, highlighting the economic and environmental trade-offs involved. The results of this study can inform decision-making for stakeholders interested in developing sustainable waste management strategies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCatalytic pyrolysis is a very promising chemical upcycling approach as it is feedstock agnostic. However, its high energy demand can lead to significant carbon dioxide production. While light olefins (C2-C4) have been produced, the selectivity to larger olefins (>C4; valued at $ 1700 Mt-1), chemical industry's building blocks for lubricants, surfactants, plasticizers, etc., is usually very low. Larger olefins are typically made from smaller ones and their direct production from plastic waste can fill in a significant market gap but this has seldomly been done so far. In this work, we demonstrate a single-pot, microwave (MW) - slurry catalytic reactor to selectively convert Low-density Polyethylene (LDPE) to medium-sized olefins in seconds at low reaction temperatures. The solid acid catalyst profoundly controls the selectivity to olefins. We systematically investigate the influence of catalyst acidity, nature of acid sites and porosity on the catalytic deconstruction of LDPE and provide insights onto depolymerization chemistry. We also demonstrate that the MW outperforms conventional heating (CH) pyrolysis by reducing coke and the slurry enables enhanced transport to increase effective rates and reduce reaction times. Technoeconomic analysis and life cycle assessment were performed to demonstrate the potential of the technology.",

The fashion industry contributes to a significant environmental issue due to the increasing demand and production. Today, many post-consumer textiles produced consist of mixed fibers. Recycling mixed fibers is challenging due to the blend of materials and contaminants such as additives, dyes, and finishes. Mechanical recycling of textiles has been the predominant recycling means. However, mechanically recycled textiles exhibit reduced fiber strength due to the down-cycling process, with applications limited to low-value products such as carpeting and upholstery. The textile industry, with its ever-growing environmental footprint, needs sustainable, efficient, and economical recycling technologies for mixed textiles. In this work, we implement solvolysis in the presence of various earth-abundant heterogeneous catalysts to depolymerize mixed textile.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants, transportation, and a range of industrial processes have contributed to the alarming increase in atmospheric levels of greenhouse gasses. To avoid catastrophic clime change, it is essential not only to reduce CO2emission, but find new ways to capture and reuse the CO2to produce a circular economy. While there are numerous technologies for capturing and sequestering CO2emissions from industrial sources and direct air capture (DAC), there remains a need for new routes to recycle CO2into useful products. However, due to the high thermodynamic stability of CO2, conventional chemical synthesis routes require high temperatures and pressures to drive the reaction, requiring high energy use and limiting economic viability. One method to reducing the energy requirements and facilitating the use of CO2is the use of electrochemical approaches to activate the CO2and provide an alternative low temperature and pressure reaction pathway. Carboxylic acids are an exciting for recycling CO2, as they represent an important intermediates for a wide range of polymers, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. However, the high thermodynamic stability of CO2and activation energy required for conventional thermochemical synthetic approaches are cost prohibitive.Mainstream will present and discuss our electroorganic synthesis approach to producing carboxylic acids using simple, scalable reaction conditions and a range of model substrates. The synthesis is made possible using custom gas diffusion-based electrodes, which provide the optimum catalytic electrochemical reaction interface. They are designed to prevent liquid electrolyte loss while allowing the maximum CO2electrode. We discuss our cell and seal design, the effects of solvent and supporting electrolytes, and charge carriers to produce a scalable electroorganic synthesis approach to the capture and reuse of CO2. This equipment can also leverage a paired synthesis, producing useful products at both the cathode and the anode.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCO2hydrogenation to methane is a potential strategy for CO2utilization as methane can be readily used in existing natural gas infrastructure for power generation. Nickel as a methanation catalyst has been widely studied because of its promising activity, low cost, and high availability however there are challenges from coke formation and sintering. As one strategy to improve nickel catalysts, a variety of oxide supports are explored. Partially reducible supports in particular may improve metal dispersion, basicity, and redox potential of the catalyst which have been shown to improve performance. Here, we have investigated the nature of metal-support interactions, characterized CO2adsorption, and explored potential reaction pathways to inform improved design of Ni based catalysts.We have prepared Ni catalysts on Al2O3, CeO2, TiO2, SiO2, and mesoporous SiO2(SBA-15) by strong electrostatic adsorption. The resulting catalysts were characterized using XRD, physisorption, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, chemisorption, and in-situ FTIR. With the exception of Ni/CeO2, the studied catalysts with a lower onset of reduction were found to have a higher turnover frequency. Ni/CeO2was found to be the most active catalyst despite a moderate onset of reduction at 225 °C; this high activity is attributed to a high fraction of weak and medium strength basic sites and high, surface area normalized CO2adsorption. From in-situ FTIR, we observe only adsorbed CO species on inert supports (Ni/SiO2and Ni/SBA-15) while we observe carbonate and formate species on ‘active’ supports (Ni/Al2O3, Ni/TiO2, Ni/CeO2). So, we hypothesize that CO species are formed on Ni0sites and for active supports, the COspecies transfer to the support to form carbonate and formate species. We have shown how Ni structures and therefore reaction pathways for Ni catalysts vary across supports, leading to improved activity for catalysts on reducible supports.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConversion of carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals is an attractive approach to achieve sustainability and carbon neutrality goals for chemical processes. In the nonreductive CO2conversion route, polycarbonate diols production is a lucrative option as they can be used in the synthesis of high-performance polyurethanes. Traditionally, polycarbonate diols have been produced using hazardous phosgene and dichloromethane. However, recently, an atmospheric flow-based system using only CO2and 1,6-hexanediol was demonstrated with high polycarbonate diol yields using a cerium oxide-based catalyst by Gu and coworkers. Given this three-phase system, multiple parameters need to be considered and optimized to enhance yield and selectivity to diol products.For the current work, CO2conversion into polyhexamethylene carbonate diols was investigated in a similar atmospheric flow system. Our studies evaluated parameters such as type of cerium oxide catalysts, shape of the flask, type of condenser, and addition of a dehydrating agent for the thermal system. The different CeO2catalysts were characterized using BET, Raman spectroscopy, and XRD. BET analysis was used to identify if the amount of conversion was influenced by the surface area, Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the defect (active) sites and XRD was used to identify different phases of the catalyst. The reaction products were qualitatively analyzed using FTIR and quantitatively by using GC and GPC.It was found that the shape of the flask influenced the mixing behavior of the fluid, and thus improved water removal and consequently increased the yield of polycarbonate diol. Whereas length of the condenser influenced the overall mass balance (evaporation loss) of the reaction system and the tightly packed condenser resulted in lowering evaporation losses. Addition of a dehydrating agent helped further improve the yield of the polycarbonate diol indicating that water was not completely removed and further optimization might be necessary.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDirect Air Capture (DAC) is under investigation for achieving the goal of “net zero-CO2 emission” to curb the global warming effect. Dual function materials (DFM) comprised of 0.25%Ru, 6.1%Na2O/g -Al2O3//Monolith were evaluated at low levels of Ru for about 250 hours (TOS) at various simulated ambient climate capture conditions followed by methanations at up to 280°C. This paper focuses on the impact of thrifting Ru below 1% in a DFM on the extent of CO2ambient capture and conversion to CH4. This is consistent with the positive effect of Ru loading on enhancing CO2adsorption, as previously reported. The CO2conversion to CH4(~50%) was the same as with 1%Ru regardless decrease in Ru loading from 1% to 0.25% in the DFM, suggesting even lower levels may be possible. Much of the 50% unreacted CO2will mostly be converted to CH4when 100% renewable H2is used in the final process.The technology readiness of DFM is very competitive compared to other DAC technologies. Applying DFM on monolithic substrates (supports used in catalytic converters) has been verified with a lower pressure drop than using particle structures in a packed bed. The presented low Ru alkaline DFM's stable performance would significantly decrease the overall capital cost and give more potential to a large-scale direct air capture and methanation (DACM) application, based on the current price of Ru of $16.4/g (April 2023).Ru crystallite size before and after aging is essential in relating its role in performance changes. Often in other catalytic systems, an increased catalyst size would cause impaired catalytic activity. For the first time, the Ru crystallites with a wide size range from < 2nm to ~25nm were observed by using STEM-EDS elemental mapping, and the increased Ru crystallite sizes after aging showed no decreased catalytic activity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTandem hydrogenation of CO2to C5+hydrocarbons is an attractive solution for mitigating CO2emissions while producing drop-in replacements for fossil-derived products. This could be achieved by coupling two reactions in the same reactor, which involves the transfer of key reaction intermediates from one system to another. Recent studies show that In2O3combined with HZSM-5 converts CO2to gasoline range (C5+) hydrocarbons through a two-step process in which CO2and H2produce methanol over In2O3and then methanol is dehydrated and coupled over HZSM-5 to form hydrocarbons. However, the low conversion and selectivity to C5+hydrocarbons demand a more detailed investigation of the catalytic process to improve hydrocarbon selectivity and catalyst design. Herein, we elucidate how the selection of reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, GHSV) and catalyst configuration can influence the selectivity of hydrogenation products. We demonstrate the optimal reaction conditions required to suppress reverse water gas shift and methanation reaction to increase C5+selectivity. We investigate the effect of the integration manner of In2O3and HZSM-5 on hydrocarbon distribution by changing the spacing of their active sites. We observe that increasing the proximity from the millimeter scale to the micro-scale increases C5+selectivity from 2% to 55%. However, nano-scale proximity yields mostly methane (70%) and no C5+hydrocarbon. Characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts with ammonia TPD reveals that in nano-scale proximity the acidity of HZSM-5 decreases. Hence, we hypothesize that migration of In ion to zeolite driven by the harsh reaction conditions could passivate zeolite in nanoscale proximity. To further investigate, we intentionally passivate HZSM-5 with Na+to evaluate catalytic activity at micro-scale proximity, which yields mostly methane similar to the nano-scale arrangement of In2O3and HZSM-5. To conclude, the selectivity of hydrogenation products can be steered by the selection of reaction parameters and proximity of catalyst components.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAn approach that combines fundamental research and process engineering is essential to develop new technologies with zero environmental impact as an alternative to fossil fuels. Water electrolysis in integrated photoelectrochemical cells (IPECs1) is a promising strategy to convert solar energy into hydrogen that can be used as an energy vector.We present an autonomous solar integrated fuel station (EASI Fuel), with a photon capture surface2of several hundreds of cm², resulting from an elaborate integration and scale-up process to couple a series of IPECs with a methanogenesis bioreactor. EASI Fuel makes full use of solar energy (both photovoltaic and thermal aspects) for methane production from CO2and H2, reducing the carbon footprint in favor of sustainable economy.The current communication focuses on two key points:what can be the advantages of electrical, fluidic and thermal integration in the transition from laboratory to pilot scale?how does the dispersion data of IPECs affect the performance of the overall device?Electrochemical and photo-electrochemical measurements, confirm the correct functioning of 3D printed-hybrids IPEC modules; while biological characterizations underline the high degree of selectivity of the methane-producing microorganisms3. The results, after long-term outdoor experiments, highlight the robustness, the versatility and the stability of the solar fuel station, demonstrating the achievement of a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5.With a solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of about 5%, and a peak production of 10 kWhCH4, which is remarkable compared to the state of the art, the EASI Fuel technology is seen as an interesting complement to biogas plants, and a promising route, toward sustainable fuels, for heavy transportation.1 S.

A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) reactor model was also developed, and the nature of the flow and reaction occurring inside the reactor was demonstrated. The kinetic parameters from the kinetic model were used as reaction source terms for the CFD reactor model development. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the design variables by integrating the kinetic parameters from the developed kinetic model. The Bayesian optimization algorithm was used to optimize the catalytic CO2hydrogenation reactor. The optimal design was acquired, and the CO2conversion increased by 32.6% compared to the initial base case. The optimal reactor operation conditions identified. An optimized reactor design was proposed for the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2to formic acid within a catalytic trickle-bed reactor based on the integration of reaction kinetic modeling and CFD analysis.

    "abstract": "AbstractAccelerating deployment of decarbonization technologies is desperately needed to limit global warming to less than 2 °C. The petrochemical industry is particularly difficult to decarbonize because CO2intensive thermocatalytic processes are entrenched in our infrastructure. To enable rapid decarbonization, we aim to accelerate design and testing of catalysts by redefining catalyst representation and structure-property relationships with large language models (LLMs). The result is a new research direction where we represent catalysts by the synthesis method, reaction conditions, and performance. The method is therefore verifiable and actionable – we can immediately synthesize and test the outcomes generated by the model. We are targeting CO2hydrogenation to showcase how a complicated and temporally relevant reaction can be cheaply and easily represented via natural language processing. Our initial efforts are focused on tungsten carbide catalysts because of the existence of two distinct carbide phases, tungsten carbide (WC) and tungsten semi-carbide (W2C). With this example, we demonstrate how we can apply Bayesian optimization to a limited data set to identify the top performing WC-based catalysts for reverse water-gas shift with a minimum number of experiments.In our approach, we are leveraging the LLM to better understand how WC structure affects CO2hydrogenation properties. W2C has emerged as a promising candidate for CO2hydrogenation, likely because the electronic structure have similar features to the active Mo2C catalyst when WC and MoC have same bulk structures. Through carefully controlling the carburization conditions, particle size and composition of the tungsten-based catalysts, and representing the catalysts with the synthesis procedures and reaction conditions, we aim to uncover a new classification of structure-property relationships that will expand the library of active, selective, and earth-abundant catalysts for CO2hydrogenation.",

Scientific tasks gradually shift from fundamental atomistic simulations to large dataset acquisition to optimize even greater chemical space. Several new data projects have spun recently which make this new mode of operation possible. However many scientific gaps remain particularly within availability, reproducibility, and re/usability as mandated by the recent DOE's Public Reusable Research (PuRe) Data efforts. These issues are additionally amplified by the lack of a suitable catalyst genome format.In this talk, I will introduce the current datasets and formatting used by Catalysis-hub.org and discuss examples of their real-world use.In the first case study, I will highlight the use of our large OER datasets in connection with MaterialsProject.org stability data to achieve rapid down-selection of candidate metal oxide catalysts for acidic OER catalysis [1]. In the second case study, we computed highly accurate adsorption energies across the 3d,4d, and 5d rutile series, and other oxides and extracted universal electronic based on Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) method [2]. For our most popular use case, I will mention the variety of possible deployments of the extended bimetallic alloy dataset [3] for thermodynamic and structural ML models. These specific use cases allowed us to test our current approach and its limitations. The largest limiting factors are mostly related to reproducibility and reusability, in terms of accuracy, uniqueness, and storage formats.

    "abstract": "AbstractGraph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been demonstrated to be excellent surrogate models to map catalyst structures to properties. However, determining their fidelity outside the training space—where discovery of catalysts with improved properties is likely—is a challenge. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques that provide an uncertainty estimate associated with a model prediction have been increasingly used for this purpose in a workflow commonly termed as active learning. In this workflow, model predictions are iteratively improved in a region of interest wherein new datapoints are sampled using an acquisition function, which balances both the exploitation of the target property and exploration of input space regions that show high uncertainty.In this work, we demonstrate the utility of such an active learning workflow in extrapolating predictions of a GCN model trained exclusively on binary alloy properties to ternaries. Specifically, we develop Dropout-based Graph Convolutional Network (dGCN), a GCN model with UQ based on the CGCNN framework. We generate an initial dataset of Pd-Sn, Pt-Sn, and Pd-Pt binary alloy formation energies evaluated using DFT. Next, we generate 16-atom ternary configurations for each composition in the Pd-Pt-Sn ternary space. We derive a novel acquisition function that balances minimization of the formation free energy and maximization of uncertainty, and use it to identify a composition to sample every iteration. Formation energies are evaluated using DFT for configurations in the sampled composition and added to the training set. We repeat this workflow for multiple iterations and show improvement in prediction of ternary alloy formation energies.We also compare this physics-informed workflow with a data-driven workflow that utilizes Diffusion Maps, a dimensionality reduction technique, to find the intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space and perform active learning in the reduced space. We find that both methods lead to similar improvements, albeit differing in the manner of convergence.",

    "abstract": "AbstractUnderstanding of the reaction network of Cu-catalyzed CO2/CO electroreduction reaction (CO(2)RR) remains incomplete despite intense research effort. This is at least in part because the rate determining step occurs early in the reaction network, leading to short lifetimes of subsequent surface bound intermediates, the knowledge of which is key to selectivity control. Several extensive reaction networks of the CO(2)RR on Cu have been proposed with ab initio calculations in recent publications, however, most of these pathways, along with many predicted reaction intermediates, have yet been verified due to the lack of suitable experimental techniques.Herein we first demonstrate that alkyl groups, produced from the dissociative adsorption of alkyl iodides on Cu, can effectively couple with surface intermediates in the Cu-catalyzed CORR. For the first time, elusive C1 and C2 intermediates in the CORR were captured by coupling with the alkyl groups. Combining reactivity data and in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic results, we demonstrate that surface bound alkyl groups are able to couple with adsorbed CO to form carboxylates and ketones via one and two successive nucleophilic attacks, respectively. Leveraging this new chemistry, CHx and C2Hx are intercepted and identified as precursors for methane and n-propanol in the CORR, respectively. We demonstrated reaction pathways leading to methane and C2+ products were not intrinsically orthogonal, and their connection is mainly impeded by low coverages of surface intermediates. The rate of C-C coupling steps in the CORR depends critically on the probability of encounter of the reactants, which makes the introduction of adsorbed alkyl groups especially suitable to intercept surface intermediates involved in the C-C coupling step of the CORR. The strategy proposed in the manuscript that perturbing the reaction of interest by introducing a slightly interacting probe reaction network could be general and informative to mechanistic studies of electrocatalytic reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe understanding of CO2reduction reaction (CO2RR) mechanisms on Cu surfaces is essential for enhancing the conversion of CO2into value-added multicarbon (C2+) products. The electroreduction of CO, the undisputed intermediate in the formation of methane and C2+products, serves as an ideal proxy for mechanistic study because it removes the complexity of multiple aqueous phase equilibria among CO2, HCO3-and CO32-, while the absolute coverage of CO has been a missing piece in mechanistic puzzle of CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu. In this talk, we present a high-pressure in situ surface enhanced infrared spectroscopy method at CO pressures up to 60 barg to reveal the upper bound of the CO coverage under electrocatalytic conditions to be 0.05 monolayer at atmospheric CO pressure and the saturation CO coverage to be ~0.25 monolayer based on the dynamical dipole coupling behavior of adsorbed CO. Combining with reactivity investigation at corresponding pressures, we present several new insights into the CO2RR mechanism. (1) C-C coupling is unlikely the rate-determining step for C2+product formation, as reaction orders with respect to adsorbed CO are significantly less than unity; (2) increased CO coverage enhances selectivity towards oxygenates, particularly acetate, due to reduced C affinity; (3) high CO coverage likely promotes a novel symmetrical C-C coupling mechanism, yielding uncommon products such as ethane, glycolaldehyde, and ethylene glycol. This study provides an effective approach to bridge the coverage of reactant adsorbate and reactivity to reveal the mechanism of electrochemical reaction involving gaseous molecules, which is essentially beneficial for the design of advanced catalysts and reaction system.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn electrocatalysis, mechanistic analysis of reaction rate data often relies on linearization of relatively simple rate equations; this is the basis for typical Tafel and reactant order dependence analyses. However, for more complex reaction phenomena, such as surface coverage effects or mixed control between multiple pathways, these common linearization strategies will yield incomplete or uninterpretable results. Cohesive kinetic analysis, which is often used in thermocatalysis and involves quantitative model fitting for data collected over a wide range of reaction conditions, provides a more robust strategy for interrogating electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms. However, this analysis strategy requires substantially more experimental rate data. In this work, we report a robotic system that automates collection of electrochemical reaction rate data. To be more tailored toward the application of kinetic analysis, our robotic system automatically performs queued electrochemical experiments that can accommodate a different electrode, electrolyte, and gas-phase reactant for each individual experiment. We use this system to investigate the mechanism of carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2RR) to carbon monoxide (CO) at various immobilized metal tetrapyrroles. We first study immobilized cobalt phthalocyanine, where cohesive kinetic analysis of reaction data collected over a wide range of reaction conditions has previously been reported. We then extend the kinetic analysis to additional metal tetrapyrroles, such as cobalt and iron tetraphenyl porphyrins, commonly used as catalysts for CO2RR to CO. Our analyses suggest that complex reaction mechanisms involving electrolyte adsorption and potential-dependent degrees of rate control are prevalent across this class of electrocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe development of efficient renewable energy conversion and storage devices is one of the most important challenges of the 21stcentury. Thus, it is essential to mitigate climate change by reducing CO2emissions. This can be addressed by using renewable electricity to manufacture chemical fuels and synthetic precursors, or by generating electricity with carbon-neutral fuel cell devices. However, these electrocatalytic processes are hampered by low efficiencies and poor reaction selectivity. This problem is caused by a lack of guiding principles for choosing reaction conditions that will lead to the preferred electrochemical activities. For example, the role of water, a central solvent for most electrochemical reactions, is poorly understood.Water is the principal proton donor for electrochemical reactions which take place at pHs > 7. Many reactions involve proton transfer steps; therefore, the supply of the proton donor (i.e. water) to the interface will have a substantial impact on reactivity and selectivity. A new type of aqueous system known as water-in-salt electrolyte (WISE) reduce the activity of water. In this talk I will discuss our efforts on elucidating the role of water in controlling the bifurcation of CO2electro-reduction between C2+and C1products by utilizing NaClO4-based WISE electrolytes. We demonstrated that the C2+/C1ratios were enhanced up to 20x by reducing the water activity (aw) from 0.97 to 0.47, demonstrating unrivaled tunability between C1and C2+products on the same electrode. Furthermore, kinetic analysis revealed that C2products exhibited negative reaction orders across a wide range of aw; demonstrating that the restricted water supply enhanced their formation at the expense of C1products",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is promising for the mitigation of carbon emissions and building up carbon-neutral energy infrastructures. However, the undesired side reaction with CO2has limited the practical implementation of alkaline electrolytes in CO2electrolyzers. This challenge can be circumvented by the sequential electroreduction of CO2to CO and then CO to C2+. Thus, electroreduction of carbon monoxide (CO) possesses great potential for achieving the renewable synthesis of hydrocarbon chemicals from CO2. We report here selective reduction of CO to acetate using Cu–Pd bimetallic electrocatalysts. Surfactant-free Cu–Pd nanocrystals were synthesized with control over the composition (Cu70Pd30, Cu49Pd51, Cu23Pd77) and applied for electrocatalytic studies by using gas-diffusion electrodes and flowing alkaline catholytes. High activity and selectivity are demonstrated for CO-to-acetate conversion with >200 mA/cm2in geometric current density and >65% in Faradaic efficiency (FE). An asymmetrical C–C coupling mechanism is proposed to explain the composition-dependent catalytic performance and high selectivity toward acetate. This mechanism is supported by the computationally predicted shift of the *CO adsorption from the top-site configuration on Cu (or Cu-rich) surfaces to the bridge sites of Cu–Pd bimetallic surfaces, which is also associated with the reduction of the CO hydrogenation barrier. Further kinetic analysis of the reaction order with respect to CO and Tafel slope supports a reaction pathway with *CO–*CHO recombination following a CO hydrogenation step, which could account for the electroreduction of CO to acetate on the Cu–Pd bimetallic catalysts. Our work highlights how heteroatomic alloy surfaces can be tailored to enable distinct reaction pathways and achieve advanced catalytic performance beyond monometallic catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectroreduction of CO2(eCO2RR) has emerged as a promising alternative for production of renewable fuels and important commodity chemicals such as ethylene and ethanol. Simultaneously, it opens an economically attractive path to mitigate point sources of CO2, a potent greenhouse gas. Despite decades of research efforts, Cu remains the only catalyst capable of producing significant amounts of desirable C2+products, containing more than one carbon atom. However, further improvement is needed for industrial applications. It is known that roughened copper-based electrocatalysts surfaces exhibit enhanced selectivity towards C2+products during electroreduction of CO2. This poses a challenge for modeling efforts aiming to find a rationale for the enhanced selectivity. In this work, we use an innovative modeling approach to investigate roughened copper surfaces derived from cuprous oxide on structures of 100x100 nm2size with atomic resolution and accuracy compared to density functional theory (DFT). We combine semilocal DFT (RPBE) in VASP, effective medium theory (EMT), and linear scaling relationships via the recently proposed alpha parameter scheme to investigate the site resolved catalytic selectivity of copper sites. Electrode potential dependence is included via the use of the VASPsol implicit solvation and a grand canonical potential approach. The approach allows us to investigate the effect of varied macroscopic roughness on the intrinsic catalytic activity of copper by comparing surfaces exposed to simulated sputtering and electropolishing, respectively. The study highlights i) the challenge for designing improved copper catalysts for CO2RR with monodisperse active site selectivity, ii) the need for careful experimentation when comparing to theory, and iii) the limitations of macroscopic roughness in controlling atomic scale activity.",

The above-mentioned areas are not explored well in the literature. In this work, we screened a wide range of metallic catalyst materials for urea synthesis. The catalysts that reduce CO2to CO and HCOOH are active for urea synthesis. Ag is the best catalyst for selective synthesis of urea with near 100 % selectivity. The system can be operated dynamically over a potential range of -0.5 to -1.5 V vs. RHE without compromising the selectivity of urea. The concentration of NO3-and CO2play a major role in determining the selectivity of urea. Ag GDE is used to overcome the mass transfer limitations and we report a high urea current density of ~-100 mA/cm2with a urea Faradaic Efficiency of ~100 % at -1.2 V vs. RHE which is the highest so far reported in the literature. DFT calculations are performed to get insights on the electrochemical C-N bond formation. A combination of facile first and second C-N bond formation steps and an endergonic formamide formation step from *CONH2results in improved kinetics and selectivity towards urea synthesis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an essential chemical utilized in disinfection, water treatment, chemical synthesis, and the paper and pulp manufacturing industry. Our group produces H2O2via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-­-ORR), which utilizes electricity from renewable resources. This technique has several advantages over the current industrial method for H2O2synthesis, the anthraquinone process. No organic waste is produced; the infrastructure is not limited to a centralized location, reducing transportation costs; and the emissions are clean. Much of the H2O2literature has focused on electrosynthesis in alkaline electrolytes as the higher pH environment favors the ORR over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the implementation of H2O2electrosynthesis in an acidic environment could help with the commercialization of practical H2O2electrolyzers due to the superior stability of thein-situgenerated H2O2in low pH solutions and the compatibility with commercially-available proton-exchange membranes (PEMs). In order to exploit both high selectivity toward H2O2product and high stability of the generated H2O2, we introduced cationic surfactants to a strongly acidic solution, which increased the H2O2selectivity at low pH from 12% to 95% Faradaic efficiency (FE) under a current density of 200 mA cm-2. We employedin-situsurface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and optical microscopy (OM) in order to understand the behavior of the electrode-electrolyte interface under electrolysis operating conditions. The results from our experiments demonstrate that the surfactant molecules become attracted to the electrode surface, likely displacing protons at the electrode-electrolyte interface, and thus promoting the ORR over HER. We also detected micelles in solution under OM imaging, which can facilitate O2gas transport to the electrode surface, further favoring ORR conditions to produce H2O2.Figure 1.

    "abstract": "AbstractBy 2050, the global population is projected to reach over 9 billion people, resulting in a need to grow over 13.5 billion tons of crops. Synthetic fertilizer is responsible for almost half of the world’s current food production and will be essential to meet growing demands. Nitrates are key components in fertilizers produced by Haber-Bosch and Ostwald processes, requiring high operating temperatures and pressures. Utilizing renewable electricity to electrochemically produce nitrate, which holds the potential to mitigate up to 1Gton of CO2 emissions annually, has proven to be challenging due to the stability of the triple bond in nitrogen gas and limitations in mass transport due to reactor design.In this work, we have developed a process for nitrate production from nitrogen at ambient conditions using advanced manufactured (AM) electrochemical reactors. Through rapid, iterative reactor design, we significantly improve the mass transport of nitrogen gas to the catalyst. Using these reactors, we studied the nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) across a range of pH conditions and electrolytes on metal oxide catalysts. Computational and experimental findings suggest that by engineering an electrode-electrolyte-cell configuration, we can shift selectivity of NOR over the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work represents a promising approach for achieving NOR at high current densities and selectivities for sustainable, decentralized fertilizer production.This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrocatalysis can significantly reduce fossil fuel resources required for chemical production processes by replacing temperature and pressure with electricity as a driving force, and will become increasingly attractive as renewable energy sources increase the supply and decrease the price of electricity. Electrochemically facilitating these reactions also introduces new process parameters, such as electrolyte pH, electrolyte ion concentration, and operating potential, which can be tuned to optimize efficiency.One potential candidate for electrification is the field of selective oxidation, which are critical reactions for converting carbon feedstocks into a plethora of important products. For example, epoxides and diols play an important role in the production of essential chemical products including surfactants, epoxies, and pharmaceuticals. Replacing traditional oxidation processes, which often use expensive or toxic catalysts and harsh reagents, with electrochemical processes has the potential to reduce environmental burden while improving safety, and increasing process efficiency. As a further benefit, electrooxidation allows for the use of water as the oxygen source, removing the need for strong and reactive oxidizing agents.Here, we explore the indirect electrochemical oxidation of cyclohexene towards cyclohexene oxide via halogenated intermediates in a liquid diffusion electrode (LDE) cell. We show that halogen ion identity, concentration, and electrolyte pH play an important role in determining product distribution and Faradaic efficiency, and demonstrate an optimization towards the production of halohydrins, which can be easily epoxidized via further reaction with basic media. Faradaic efficiencies of over 50% towards the corresponding halohydrin are observed, while the application of an LDE cell allows for facile separation of the organic phase containing the halohydrin product.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical reduction of CO2is an attractive approach to utilize the captured CO2and sustainable synthesis of fuels. Synthesis of C2+products is more attractive and alkaline electrolyte needs to be used for better efficiency. Electrochemical CO2Reduction in alkaline media suffers from the loss of CO2in the form of carbonates and tuning the selectivity to liquid C2+products is challenging. Direct electrochemical reduction CO in alkaline media alleviates the problem of carbonate formation and C2+products selectivities are much higher in comparison to electrochemical CO2reduction. CO electrolysis suffers from mass transport issues as the solubility of CO is very less in water in comparison with CO2. One way to overcome the CO mass transport issue is to operate the reactor at elevated pressures. High pressures require minimal energy compared to high temperatures; hence, high-pressure electrochemical synthesis of chemicals can be scaled up for decentralized production of chemicals and capital cost will be considerably less for the decentralized production as the volume of the reactor is an exponential function of the cost. In this work, we conduct CO electrolysis at an elevated pressure of 100 bar in a custom designed autoclave on a porous oxide derived Cu catalyst. We report enhanced selectivities (>95 %) towards liquid C2+products such as ethanol, acetates, and n-propanol with a current density > ~-100 mA/cm2at -0.5 V vs. RHE. The enhanced selectivities are attributed to the electrostriction effect that enables higher stabilization of intermediates, and higher surface coverages of reactants. High-pressure CO electrolysis could be a paradigm shift in the decarbonization of chemical manufacturing, and this work would motivate researchers to explore the field.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOur planet must address pressing global issues such as climate security, food and water quality, and growing energy demand. Reactor design and manufacturing – in addition to utilizing renewable sources of power – is central to achieving progress toward addressing these concerns, particularly through electrochemical production of chemical precursors and removal of toxins and pollutants from air, water and food sources. Furthermore, understanding the mass transport phenomena occurring within these electrochemical reactors must be developed to build more efficient and effective systems. To date, the vast majority of published reports on electrochemical reactors and electrocatalysis have relied on components produced by traditional manufacturing methods, which are time- and resource intensive and can severely limit the overall system performance of the reactor.Advanced manufacturing (AM) is a promising method that holds great potential for creating novel electrochemical reactors and overcoming the limitations of conventional reactor designs, as it allows for rapid prototyping and iteration of reactor components and parts with submicron control. In this work, we demonstrate that by using AM to create electrochemical reactors, we can (1) reduce the time and cost to make electrolyzers by two orders of magnitude, (2) design and control catalyst structures with optimized fluid dynamics, (3) understand mass transport phenomena from the sub-micron through the centimeter length scales inside the reactor, and (4) improve the performance for electrocatalysis, including conversion of waste carbon and nitrogen to valuable products. By combining AM and electrochemical engineering, we show that we can shift the paradigm on reactor design and create the next generation of electrochemical reactors.This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical reduction of CO2(ECR) powered by renewable energy sources have emerged as a powerful technology to fight a global battle against climate change. Considering the huge industrial importance (global market size of $230 billion) of ethylene and its contribution towards CO2emission (~150 Mt of CO2emission per year), it is necessary to find sustainable methods for synthesizing ethylene. Therefore, this work focus on finding new avenues for electrochemical reduction of CO2to ethylene with higher product selectivity, high current density and long-term stability. A methodology is developed for catalyst regeneration under controlled microenvironments by applying oscillating reduction and oxidation currents. A zero-gap two electrode electrochemical cell is used which consists of Cu mesh, aqueous electrolyte (0.1 M KHCO3 and 1M KCl) through which CO2is sparged continuously, Ni foam as anode and a membrane between cathode and anode. The factors under consideration are: (1) reduction current , (ii) oxidation current, (iii) reduction time ; (iv) oxidation time and (v) electrolyte flow rate and (vii) catalyst surface area. In addition to this, the efficient removal of gaseous products is ensured by optimizing the inlet/outlet design of electrochemical cell. The experimental results reveal that reduction current andoxidation time are the important parameters affecting the performance of electrochemical cell. The faradaic efficiency (FE) and ethylene selectivity increases with increase in oxidation time and attains maxima at=5s.As compared to constant current operations, the oscillations lead to enhancedFE by15%. The characterization techniques such as XPS and SEM helps in identifying the presence of mixed Cu oxides and dynamic surface restructuring which attributes to higher selectivity toward ethylene. The long-term stability tests show 20% reduction inFEafter 7 days of operation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOne of the grand challenges in the contemporary world is to mitigate greenhouse gas emission that leads to climate change while meeting the increasing demand for energy and chemicals. The ~420 ppm CO2in the air also rapidly exchanges dissolved CO2in seawater. Therefore, utilizing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is equivalent to coupling direct air capture or indirect ocean carbon capture with the production of value-added materials and chemicals. It not only lowers the net emissions of CO2into the atmosphere but also valorizes the captured CO2into chemicals and fuels to fulfill a circular carbon economy. When we continuously performed CO2R without bubbling gaseous 1-atm CO2, the net proton consumption would basify the bicarbonate. Eventually, excess OH- led to near-zero bulk CO2(aq) concentrations. Therefore, we choose study photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) in dissolved bicarbonates of ~0 mM CO2(aq), challenging but relevant to carbon capture utilization.We take the approach of using the mesoscale long-range chemical transport to modulate the pH and CO2(aq) local chemical environment for photocatalytic CO2R catalysis at Ag nanoparticle active sites. We achieved record ~0.1 % solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency for CO production using Ag@CrOx nanoparticles that are supported on a coating-protected GaInP photocatalytic panel with proton-coupled redox processes. CO is produced at ~100% selectivity with no detectable H2, even with copious protons that are co-generated at nanoscale distance. At pH as high as 11, CO2flux to the Ag@CrOxCO2R sites can achieve measurable CO2adsorption which was probed by in-situ Raman spectroscopy. We found that light-driven CO2R and CO2reactive transport are mutually dependent, which is important for further understanding and manipulating CO2R activity and selectivity. This study enables direct bicarbonate utilization as the source of CO2 thereby achieving CO2 capture and conversion without purifying and feeding gaseous CO2.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAs we continue to explore electrochemical routes for a variety of reactions, most lab-scale systems are variations on the same cell design, namely an “H-cell”, which is functionally two beakers connected via a separator or membrane. While this serves well for preliminary exploration of electrochemical reactions, it remains impractical for both industrial scale-up as well as automated screening of reaction conditions. In particular, the electrolyte hydrodynamics in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) systems is an insufficiently investigated area of research that has broad implications on catalyst activity and selectivity. In this talk, I will focus on the chemical mechanism implications that result from a range of electrolyte hydrodynamics controlled via electrolyte recirculation systems. We find that increased convection at the electrode surface results directly in changes to the ethylene and methane Tafel slopes, demonstrating that mass transport is on equal footing with catalyst active sites in determining reaction mechanisms and the ensuing product distribution. Mass transport is traditionally considered to be in the purview of systems-level engineering, yet the present work shows that CO2R mechanistic work must be considered in the context of the mass transport conditions. We extend our analysis to organic coatings, demonstrating that the films shield the active sites from variability in hydrodynamics and increase the residence time of CO so that it may be further reduced to desirable products.",

KMT’s Composition Modeling Editor (CME) transforms bulk analytical chemistry into a molecular description of the feedstock. This casts the modeling problem in molecular terms. Reactivity information is then organized in terms of quantitative linear free energy relationships. KMT’s INGen tool allows for the model equations to be built and coded on the computer. KMT’s Kinetic Model Editor (KME) allows for the solution of this chemical reaction network, in the context of the chemical reactor, which provides a prediction of the molecular composition that can then be organized into any desired commercially relevant outputs.This approach is illustrated through the development of molecule-based models for refinery units.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLignocellulose is a highly-abundant, renewable bio-composite derived from plant tissues and has drawn significant scientific attention as a feedstock for “green” chemicals and materials. Lignocellulose is comprised of three major biomacromolecules: cellulose (40 – 60 %), hemicellulose (10 – 40 %) and lignin (15 – 30 %). Historically, chemical pulping (e.g., kraft) of lignocellulose has followed “cellulose-first” approaches that prioritize procuring cellulosic fractions. During kraft pulping, macromolecular lignins are degraded into smaller, alkaline-soluble species that form “black” liquors, which are incinerated to generate low-grade heat and recoup pulping chemicals. Nevertheless, lignins are the most abundant, biogenic source of aromatic chemicals and their valorization into value-added products could enhance the economic viability of biorefineries.“Lignin-first” biorefining is facilitated by organosolv pulping, a solvothermal process (100-250 °C) that applies organic solvents and chemical additives to extract lignins (50-90 wt%). However, organosolv pulping has been commercialized sparingly due to volatile organic solvents necessitating specialized, high-pressure equipment (10-35 bar). Glycerol-derived compounds (GDCs) are a new class of biobased solvents synthesized from glycerol, an ample and inexpensive byproduct of the biodiesel industry. GDCs possess tailorable molecular structures and solvent properties (e.g., high boiling points). As such, GDCs constitute a new class of organosolv solvents that promote lignin-first biorefining.The present study investigates GDC organosolv pulping under mild conditions for extracting lignins. The influence of GDC structure, additives, and process conditions (e.g., temperature, time) on the biorefining of lignocellulose into cellulose and lignin product fractions are evaluated. Physical and chemical phenomena governing GDC organosolv pulping of lignocellulosic biomass are elucidated through characterization of cellulose and lignin product fractions by a suite of wet chemistry, spectroscopic, and microscopic methodologies. The outcomes of the present investigation advance the development of environmentally-cogent and scalable organosolv processes for valorizing lignocellulose into feedstocks for value-added, biobased materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAfter a course in life cycle assessment (LCA), I wondered whether the high-temperature, high-pressure system Phil Savage, my graduate advisor, and I were using to synthesize chemicals in water offered environmental advantages compared to conventional chemical processes that used milder conditions but less benign solvents.Phil encouraged me to use LCA and “go figure it out”.That nudge and encouragement led to my first LCA paper.Ever since, I have been exploring sustainability-related questions relevant to the fuels, chemicals, water, and materials sectors using LCA as a grounding framework.I will present a broad overview and two case studies of my work in this field, which are all grounded in my training as a chemical engineer and the freedom and support Phil offered me as a student in his group.The first case study I will describe is the development of new methods to assess biofuel land use change greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.These emissions can dominate biofuel LCA results and are one of the potential unintended consequences of increasing biofuel production.I will describe how my collaborations with agricultural economists, computer scientists, and soil scientists, led to advancements in estimating land use change and its impact on GHG emissions.The second case study entails working towards new frameworks and data sources for social LCA of minerals mining for lithium-ion battery components.Overall, as I build my career, I continue to recall the nudge from Phil to push into new-to-me areas when there are important questions to address.Moreover, I strive to be the calm and confident anchor for students in my group as they take risks and encounter challenges just as Phil provided that grounding for me during my graduate school years.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo align with the net zero emissions goal, decarbonizing the chemical industry becomes crucial and inevitable. Industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is the second largest source, taking 28% of the 2020 annual carbon emissions in the United States.[1] Electrification of the chemical industry enables the integration of cleaner energy sources such as renewables. However, the variation in renewable energy supply is a key challenge in electrifying industrial processes. Thermal energy storage (TES) utilizes low-cost storage mediums such as molten salt, rock, and sand that are non-toxic and more accessible, making it easier to scale up for industrial integration [2]. With the support from TES, renewable power electrical heaters can replace fossil fuel in chemical plants reducing at least one-third of the GHG emission in the manufacturing process.[2] Methods of mathematical optimization can be used to synthesize and design of utility systems. Papoulias and Grossmann (1983) proposed a MILP approach based on the LP transshipment model for the synthesis of flexible utility for changing process demand.[3] Multiperiod heat integration (MPHI) was developed to take into account process parameters varying over time. TES was introduced to MPHI problems to reduce energy demand and waste. Möhren et al. presented a simultaneous MILP model for TES integrating waste heat recovery [4]. Another TES-integrated MPHI was formulated into a non-convex MINLP model to optimize power cycle heat exchanger networks with different operation modes for renewables. [5]So far, MPHI only considers several operating models for utility systems and energy storage. No research has time discretization involved in the multi-period model. There is a need for systematic methods that simultaneously consider the time-varying utility supply from renewables, the integration of TES with heat exchanger networks, and the scheduling of optimal charging/discharging operations. In this work, we first extend the LP transshipment model to minimize the TES size while maximizing the heat integration between hot and cold process streams under a time-varying renewable supply. Including year-wide energy scheduling with hourly resolution results in a large-scale optimization model. We propose a solution strategy to combine daily model with hourly resolution with yearly model with daily resolution to reduce the size of model.The general problem for the multi-period heat integration with renewable utility and TES is constructed as the following. We are given a set of hot and cold stream inlet and outlet temperatures, flow rates, and heat capacity. Wind or solar power profile (Texas 2020 from ERCOT) is assigned to the plant in proportion to total generation with a constant price. Besides TES, the plant is equipped with a green hydrogen burner to encounter extreme situations. The objective is to minimize the levelized cost of the electrical heating (LCOEH) to obtain the optimal TES capacity, the amount of green hydrogen for backup heating, and hourly scheduling of TES charging and discharging. By varying the share proportion, we found that the variation in electricity supply dramatically influences the size of TES capacity and the use of backup green hydrogen. The LCOEH increased by 30% when the share of wind was reduced from 0.4% to 0.3%. The LCOEH is tripled in the solar case, further illustrating this conclusion. When the variation is too significant, burning green hydrogen during peak hours is more profitable than sizing up energy storage. Furthermore, we found that the increasing cost of green hydrogen affects the LCOEH to some extent depending on the variation in the electricity profile. The case study is extended to varying electricity prices by including real-time and day-ahead electricity price profiles in 8 locations in Texas. The flexibility in changing electricity demand allows the plant to take advantage of price variations, leading to lower energy costs. Future studies could consider participating in electricity market demand bidding to gain profit for flexible operations and alleviate increasing energy costs from electrification.References[1] EIA.

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrifying chemical productions is a potential approach to decarbonizing the chemical industry. Currently, 21% of the global greenhouse gas emissions comes from the industry sector, while chemical manufacturing accounts for the largest share of industrial carbon emissions. The electrochemical processes, when powered by renewable electricity, have lower carbon footprints than conventional thermochemical routes. The rapid development of renewable energy provides opportunities in electrifying chemical production and decarbonizing chemical industry. In this presentation, I would like to use electrosynthesis of value-added ethylamine and ethylene glycol as two examples.First, I would like to talk about electroreduction of acetonitrile for selective synthesis of primary amines. Primary amines are important organic building blocks; however, the synthesis is often hindered by the poor selectivity because of the formation of secondary and tertiary amine byproducts. We report an electrocatalytic route to produce ethylamine selectively through an electroreduction of acetonitrile at ambient temperature and pressure. Among all the electrocatalysts, Cu nanoparticles exhibited the highest ethylamine Faradaic efficiency (FE, ~96%) at -0.29 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In a flow cell configuration, an ethylamine partial current density of 846 mA cm-2was achieved using the Cu catalyst at -0.73 V vs. RHE in a 1 M NaOH electrolyte containing 12 wt.% acetonitrile. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of acetonitrile electroreduction was investigated by operando electrochemical differential mass spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.In the second part of this presentation, I would like to share our recent progress on ethylene glycol electrosynthesis. Ethylene glycol is mainly used as precursor of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and antifreeze, with a world annual capacity of 42.09 Mt/yr. Conventionally, ethylene glycol is produced through ethylene partial oxidation at high temperature, followed by ethylene oxide hydrolysis, which has a significant carbon footprint. Here we report an electrochemical approach for ethylene glycol electrosynthesis with >90% selectivity towards ethylene glycol at a current density of 200 mA cm-2. The reaction mechanism is investigated through operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry experiment, isotopic-labeling experiment, and density functional theory calculation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass produces bio-oil, a mixture of several hundred compounds containing different oxygenated functionalities including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) may be applied to produce fuels and chemicals from bio-oil under fairly mild conditions (ambient pressure and temperature < 80 ℃). Promising results have been obtained for ECH of singular model compounds (e.g. furfural, 4-alkylguaiacols, di-p-tolyl ether) using noble metal electrocatalysts (ruthenium-platinum supported on an activated carbon cloth). However, ECH of multi-compound mixtures and bio-oil fractions remains a challenging prospect. It was observed during preliminary trials on whole bio-oil ECH that presence of compounds with an aldehyde functionality (e.g., furfural) inhibited the reduction of other compounds such as phenols and guaiacols. Therefore, ECH of a binary mixture containing a phenolic compound (4-propylphenol) and a heteroaromatic aldehyde (furfural) was investigated in the present study. Reagent-based reduction of the aldehyde group to an alcohol using sodium borohydride prior to ECH suppressed the inhibitory effect of the aldehyde group and improved reactivity of the phenolic compound during ECH. A similar approach involving chemical pre-reduction and ECH was subsequently extended to bio-oil fractions wherein it was observed that reduction of the aldehyde moieties to alcohols enabled conversion of the phenolic compounds present in the bio-oil fractions to cycloalkanols and cycloalkanes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEfforts to decarbonize the chemical industry have led to interest in renewable feedstock materials, such as biomass derived species, and a desire to couple reactions with intermittent renewable energy sources like solar or wind. Furfural is one biomass derived species that has been identified as a promising building block chemical due to its abundance and array of valorized products that can be formed. Furfural (FF) can be electrochemically reduced via hydrogenation to form furfuryl alcohol (FA), or hydrogenolysis to form 2-methylfuran (MF). FA is used to produce temperature stable resins and molds for foundry industry, and MF has been identified as a high octane fuel or fuel additive.In acidic solutions on Cu electrodes, the electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions proceed in parallel reactions, showing that FA is not an intermediate in the formation of MF. For the selective production of the MF product on Cu electrodes, an acidic electrolyte is necessary, however it has been shown that FA and MF will undergo homogeneous side reactions in the acid leading to undesirable humin formation. At high concentrations of FF with long durations of electrolysis, fouling of Cu catalysts leading to performance drop has been shown as well. Understanding the different pathways to desired and undesired reactions that occur is key in designing catalysts and reactors that can increase the selectivity to desired products and minimize side reactions.In this work, the characteristics and kinetics of desired and undesired reactions that occur during the electrochemical hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of furfural on Cu in acidic solutions will be presented. We identified kinetic models for the desired electrochemical reactions towards FA and MF suggesting that they are formed via the non-competitive Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism through different intermediates. Undesired reactions occur both at the electrode, in terms of fouling, as well as homogeneously in electrolyte due to acidity. The undesired fouling reactions were found to be potential dependent, showing polymer formation or graphitic coking at moderate and high negative overpotentials, respectively. In solution, the undesired homogeneous reactions consumed FA and MF and were shown to follow first order kinetics with the proton activity and the concentration of FA or MF.",

The presented work focuses on designing downstream separations for such an e-refinery that converts CO2to ethylene with syn gas, acetic acid, and ethanol as by- products. We strategically utilize an input of methane to achieve >90% conversion of CO­2directly captured from air or flue gas. The process has negative net carbon footprint and improves overall conversion efficiency of the process by an order of magnitude without any changes to the reactor itself.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMolecular separations(separation of mixtures forming atrue solution) are ubiquitous in chemical and petrochemical industries. Such separations are energy-intensive, so improving their efficiency is crucial for the reduction of the overall energy consumption of a chemical plant. Membrane-distillation hybrids are believed to reduce the energy requirement for separation dramatically. Therefore, in this work, we systematically investigate the potential that membrane-distillation hybrids hold in increasing the overall efficiency of separation of a binary non-azeotropic mixture. We begin with the description of a few physical insights that explain when and why is the hybrid more efficient than the individual separation technologies. Based on the insights, we then construct a superstructure that encompasses a wide variety of membrane-distillation hybrids. For this superstructure, we formulate a simplified optimization problem that identifies the most efficient hybrid arrangement. When desired, the solution to the optimization problem is further refined by carrying rigorous simulations in Aspen Plus. Using this framework, we analyze the potential of hybrids for three broad classes of separations: (1) close-boiling liquid separations, for which o-xylene/p-xylene is chosen as a representative mixture, (2) close-boiling gaseous separations, for which propylene/propane is chosen as a representative mixture, and (3) “easy” liquid separations, for which benzene/toluene is chosen as a representative mixture. Our analysis shows that the improvement in efficiency is highly subjective to the feed and product specifications. While the hybrids improved the efficiency substantially in some cases, there were also cases where the improvement in efficiency was very small to justify the increase in the complexity of the process. This implies that the hybrid arrangements are more efficient only in specific cases, and we note that the physical insights described here will help in identifying those cases.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNowadays, in the U.S. more than 6.6 million tons of hazardous solid residue, called municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ash is annually generated in waste-to-energy (WTE) plants for producing electricity and reducing landfill volume. This ash cannot be further utilized for beneficial applications, so it is mostly buried and has a negative value with the cost of a disposal fee. Moreover, the economics of MSWI is challenged by the decreasing cost of renewable electricity. However, WSWI ash represents a unique opportunity for valuable element recovery, with the embodied value ranging from $100-400/tonne. We propose an electrochemical and chemical process for mining MSWI ash that utilizes electricity from the WTE plant to electrolytically produce acid and base streams for materials recovery and refining. We establish a sequential process of electrochemical extraction and chemical precipitation, and successfully recover Cu, Pb, Zn, Mg, Ca, Fe, Al, with a purified silica co-product. Recovery of >90% of the targeted elements at purities >90% is demonstrated. The industry-scale technoeconomic analysis shows our proposed technology will realize the possibility of extracting the embodied mineral value with net positive returns that significantly exceed the combined value of WTE electricity sales and landfilling cost.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo improve the efficiency of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to high valuable multi-carbon products, substantial progress has been made on the development of gas-diffusion type flow cells (e.g., microfluidic reactors and membrane electrode assembly electrolyzers) to improve the mass transport of CO2. A reservoir of flowing highly alkaline electrolyte is typically used in these electrolyzers, with the purpose of increasing the full-cell energy efficiency by reducing the voltage required to drive the coupled anodic oxygen evolution reaction. However, the use of highly alkaline electrolytes inevitably leads to electrolyte degradation and coking of the electrode due to the carbonate formation caused by the chemical reaction of CO2 and OH-, which poses great challenges to the improvement of carbon efficiency to support commercial applications. In a few recent studies, the carbonate formation problem has been effectively reduced by conducting CO2 electrolysis in strong acid media or directly implementing carbonate to CO2RR products. Despite the progress, the energy efficiency for the multi-carbon products is below expectation due to their low total Faradaic efficiency achieved at those conditions. The use of CO instead of CO2 as the feedstock offers a means to address these challenges resulted from the undesired side reaction or low selectivity. In light of the comparatively mature electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO in non-alkaline conditions (e.g., in strong acid media or using solid oxide electrochemical cell) with high efficiency, the tandem strategy in which CO2 is first reduced to CO followed by further reducing CO to multi-carbon products shows significant promise. Herein we report our latest progress in COelectroreduction using both metal and molecular catalysts to achieve high efficiency towards value-added liquid fuels[1]. Our efforts in providing mechanistic insights including reaction intermediates and pathways will also be discussed.[1] Jing Li, et al. Nature communications, 14, 698 (2023).",

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon dioxide (CO2) is a significant greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and climate change. From another perspective, CO2also can be considered a valuable carbon resource for producing various chemicals and fuels such as CO, light olefins, aviation fuel, methanol, and higher alcohols. Therefore, the realization of CO2capture and utilization is conducive to a circular carbon economy and sustainable development. CO2hydrogenation to higher alcohols is a challenging route that suffers from low selectivity and activity due to complex reaction mechanisms.In this work, a CoCu catalyst was prepared via co-precipitation of an oxalate precursor and promoted by potassium (K), which significantly enhances the selectivity to higher alcohols from CO2hydrogenation. The reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, WHSV) were investigated in detail. The role of K was studied byin situdiffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTs) and chemisorption methods. As to the catalytic performance, the alcohol selectivity increased substantially compared to pure CoCu, The K promoter is assumed to increase the reverse water gas shift activity towards CO (and H2O). Successive reaction steps typically involve those known for the CO hydrogenation over CoCu, i.e. CO insertion into surface hydroxyl and alkoxy species forming surface formate or, respectively, carboxylate-type species which undergo hydrogenation to produce hydrocarbons and alcohols. The formation of these species is demonstrated by DRIFTS. In summary, this work provides insight into how to tune the product selectivity in CO2hydrogenation by careful alkali promotion of suitable catalyst formulations.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOne promising route to mitigating CO2is using point source CO2capture technologies to create high purity CO2that can be upgraded to value added products, such as methane. Due to the high thermodynamic stability of CO2, catalytic routes are often required to convert CO2into high value products. The thermo-catalytic approach is often favored due the robust nature of the process, which can be readily scaled to demand and easily integrated into existing point source CO2sites. However, while several advances have been made in the mechanistic understanding of CO2hydrogenation, there is still need for detailed spectroscopic evidence that unambiguously link changes in the surface to shifts in the reaction mechanism.CO2methanation reactivity, reaction mechanism, and surface structure were investigated on a mechanochemically prepared Pd/CeO2catalyst (PdAcCeO2-M), where an oxidative pretreatment (-o) increased methane yield by a factor of two compared to a reductive pretreatment (-h). Methanation rates were maintained for over 48 hours and further increased upon oxidative regeneration treatments. The surface species of both PdAcCeO2-M-o and PdAcCeO2-M-h were explored viain situCO2and CO hydrogenation DRIFTS, where CO hydrogenation effectively models the dissociative CO2mechanism (CO2à CO à CH4). Additionally, isotopically labeled CO2hydrogenation showed that bridged formate was the primary intermediate and the influence of *OH/Ovacwas critical for methanation. PdAcCeO2-M-o yielded distinct Pd-CO adsorption and the absence of monodentate carbonate at ~ 1400 cm-1, while AP-XPS showed that PdAcCeO2-M-o yielded a unique Pdδ+contribution at 335.9 eV. By gaining insights from various in-situ spectroscopic techniques, and by breaking the CO2hydrogenation mechanism into piecewise steps, a deeper understanding of the direct CO2reduction towards methane and CO over mechanochemically prepared Pd/CeO2catalysts was obtained.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA novel transition metal-promoted Cu/metal oxide catalyst has been developed for the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction under low-temperature conditions. Because the rWGS reaction (CO2+ H2↔ CO + H2O, ΔH0= 42.1 kJ mol-1) is a highly promising method for CO2utilization with its high selectivity towards CO at low operating pressure, the produced syngas goes through the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis process to produce various value-added chemicals. On the other hand, high operating temperatures for rWGS by the endothermic nature result in limiting the practical applicability of rWGS catalysts. Then, various approaches have been attempted to lower the working temperature of the rWGS reaction by enhancing the reaction rate.Herein, the transition metal-promoted Cu/metal oxide catalyst was synthesized using the sol-gel combustion method. The resulting catalyst exhibited a high CO2to CO conversion rate of up to 13% even at low rWGS working temperatures (250℃), which is near its theoretical CO2to CO conversion rate of 16%. Moreover, the catalyst displayed an unprecedentedly high reaction rate of 229.0μmol∙gcat-1∙s-1at 400℃.Several experiments including H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform (DRIFTS) were conducted to investigate the synergistic effect of the transition metal promoter, in interaction with Cu/metal oxide catalyst. Based on the analysis of the H2-TPR and XPS data, the role of the transition metal promoter onto the Cu/metal oxide catalyst was clarified. The rate-determining step (RDS) and reaction mechanism of the rWGS reaction were also elucidated through DRIFTS spectra analysis.The findings will provide essential insights into optimal catalyst design criteria that can improve not only the rWGS reaction rate but also other CO2conversion reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn electro-catalytic reduction of CO2, achieving high conversion efficiency of multi-carbon (C2+) products is crucial. Cu is known to be only metal capable of reducing CO2to C2+products. Various studies have shown that increasing local concentration of intermediates such as OH-and CO*, induced by confined structure like nanowires and nanocavities, is effective in improving the selectivity of C2+products. Recently, combining CO-selective metal such as Au and Ag with Cu catalysts also reported to increase local concentration of CO. This tandem catalyst operates by a sequential reaction where CO produced on the CO-selective metal surface acts as a reactant on the Cu surface.In this study, we aimed to investigate effect of each confined structure and tandem, and to maximize the local confinement effect by combining both confined and tandem structures. We designed a nanostructure consisting of two parts: a metal film layer on the bottom and a porous Cu layer on top. To investigate confined structure effect, Cu was used for metal film layer (Cubottom/Cupore) with different pore size. On Cubottom/Cuporecatalyst, selectivity of EtOH was highly influenced by pore size, and highest on 50 nm of pore diameter. To investigate tandem effect, Au was used for metal film layer (Aubottom/Cupore), and combination of confined and tandem effects resulted in increased selectivity of C2+products compare to Cubottom/Cupore, regardless of pore size. Especially, the selectivity of EtOH reached 50.8 % at -0.9 V vs RHE. The locally confined intermediates and reaction pathway in tandem porous catalyst was inferred through in-situ ATR-SEIRAS.In summary, the novel nanostructure allowed us to identify the optimal confined structure dimensions for EtOH selectivity, resulting in significant improvement in EtOH selectivity on the tandem confined structure.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe selective conversion of CO2into chemicals and fuels can play a critical role in reducing CO2emissions. The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2(CO2RR) over Cu and Cu-based alloys has gained considerable interest due to the higher production of multi-carbon products such as ethylene and ethanol. The mechanisms and paths responsible for these transformations are complicated due to the number of electron-proton transfer steps involved and the influence of the complex metal/solution interfacial environment that drives these reactions.In this work, we examine the elementary steps involved in controlling the selectivity differences between forming ethylene vs. ethanol. In an effort to elucidate the influence of complex electrochemical metal/solution interface, we carry out potential-dependent ab-initio molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations over the Cu(111) surface in the presence of explicit solvent and electrolyte molecules. Previous simulations indicate that the CO-COH* may be a likely C-C coupling intermediate. As such, we examine in detail the elementary paths involved in the reduction of CO-COH* to form ethylene and ethanol.We first examine and compare the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and direct hydrogen atom transfer paths involved in the initial reduction of CO-COH*. Our potential-dependent simulations show that each mechanism dominates at different potential ranges. Generally, the PCET paths preferentially add hydrogen to oxygen atoms over carbon atoms in the surface species, thus driving favorable dehydration steps. Through a series of PCET steps, we examine different reduction paths from CO-COH* as well as branching points that determine the bifurcation to C2H4and C2H5OH as a function of potentials. In addition, the effects of KOH electrolytes on the reaction mechanics and product selectivity are also discussed. Our findings provide insights to improve the selectivity towards desired multi-carbon products.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIt is challenging while critical to develop efficient catalysts that can achieve both high current density and high energy efficiency for electrocatalytic CO2reduction (CO2R). Herein, we report a strategy of tailoring the surface electronic structure of an Ag catalyst via thiol ligand modification to improve its intrinsic activity, selectivity, and further energy efficiency toward CO2R. Specifically, interconnected Ag nanoparticles with residual thiol ligands on the surface were prepared through electrochemical activation of a thiol-ligand-based Ag complex. When it was used as a catalyst for CO2R, the thiol-ligand modified Ag exhibited high CO selectivity (>90%) throughout a wide electrode-potential range; furthermore, high cathodic energy efficiencies of >90% and >70% were obtained for CO formation at high current densities of 150 and 750 mA cm–2, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art Ag-based electrocatalysts for CO2to CO conversion. The first-principle calculations on the reaction energetics suggest that the binding energies of the key intermediate −*COOH on Ag are optimized by the adsorbed thiol ligand, thus favoring CO formation while suppressing the competing H2evolution. Our findings provide a rational design strategy for CO2reduction electrocatalyst by electronic modulation through surface-adsorbed ligands.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAdsorption energies, which represent the strength of chemical bonds between reaction intermediates and metal surfaces, are often correlated across different metals and similar intermediates. These scaling relations can provide valuable insights into the fundamental steps that govern electrocatalytic performance and the adsorption energies that influence them. However, the drawback of scaling relations is that they can limit the effectiveness of electrocatalytic reactions. The discovery of systems that can break adsorption energy scaling relations can provide important insight into electrocatalytic design. Recent investigations have begun to explore the potential of alloy surfaces in breaking linear relationships between adsorption energies due to their unique characteristics.In our work, we have explored the concept of selective step-decoration, a novel approach where the step-edge of a metal substrate is “decorated” with ad-atoms of another metal. This creates a model alloy surface which exposes two metal atoms with a known composition and structure, which we believe may enable the breaking of scaling relations. Using Density Functional Theory calculations, we investigated the adsorption behavior of *O, *OH, and *H on a variety of stepped surfaces (M(553), where M is a transition metal) using two different models: (1) M(553) steps decorated with metal ad-atoms and (2) M-ad-atom surface alloys (SA) created at the M(553) steps.Based on preliminary results, we can infer that both SA and step-decorated sites exhibit distinct characteristics that could be explored to enhance catalytic performance. This finding suggests that SA and step-decoration possess specific features that differ from flat surface structures. By investigating the mechanisms behind the performance differences observed between SA, step-decoration, and (553) step-sites, we can identify novel approaches to modify the electronic/geometric properties of catalyst surfaces and break scaling relations. Therefore, exploring the unique features of SA and step-decoration on step-sites holds great promise for advancing the field of electrocatalysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractActivation, break-in, or pre-treatment protocols are electrochemical techniques applied in energy-storage or -conversion devices, like fuel cells, before regular operation. While these protocols are intended to maximize the utilization of electrocatalysts, their effect on the intrinsic physical properties and the performance of the catalyst remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the role of electrochemical pre-treatment protocols by applying a design-of-experiments-based (DoE) approach to investigate the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Different pre-treatment protocols were generated based on a central composite design for five levels of five electrochemical parameters: upper potential (UPL), potential depth, sweep rate, number of cycles, and hold time at potential extrema. The experiments were performed in a flow cell combined with an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Our customized online ICP-MS setup provided simultaneous and real-time information about the electrochemical performance (mass-transfer limited current densities) and catalyst dissolution (as low as 0.1 ppb). The results indicate that applying high UPLs (~2V) during pre-treatment exhibited lower dissolution during the pre-treatment cycle than protocols with lower UPLs. However, the onset potential decreased ~5-fold during the electrochemical load cycle. On the contrary, the protocols with intermediate values of UPLs exhibited higher dissolution during pre-treatment and high onset potential during the electrochemical load cycle. The increased dissolution in pre-treatment occurred primarily due to increased dissolution while sweeping from oxidizing to reducing currents. Such insights, combined with various ex-situ structural characterization techniques, enabled us to hypothesize different physical mechanisms occurring during pre-treatment that govern the structure and final performance of the electrocatalyst. Finally, we propose a roadmap to integrate such findings to develop a causal learning model. Thus, combining DoE, online-ICP MS, and ex-situ characterization, we provide a powerful approach for gaining a mechanistic understanding of pre-treatment protocols.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrocatalysis of hydrocarbons to selectively produce alcohols has the potential to transform the manufacturing of chemicals and consumer goods in a sustainable way by replacing existing fossil-fuel-based processes by energy-saving successor technologies that utilize renewable energy.1Selective hydrocarbon oxidations to alcohols have the ultimate goal of gas-to-liquid conversion of methane to methanol without energy-intensive steam reforming. Better catalysts, reaction control, and understanding of electrocatalytic processes are needed to achieve high selectivity for single alcohol products at high activity. Arresting the oxidation of hydrocarbons at alcohols without the generation of overoxidized products is challenging because the first oxidation is thermodynamically most difficult and further oxidations are energetically downhill. We developed earth-abundant mixed-metal (hydr)oxide nanocatalysts that were synthesized by pulsed laser in liquids synthesis2and employed them on high-surface-area carbon supports3to selectively electrooxidize toluene to benzyl alcohol. We show how electrolyte engineering and concomitant accessibility of different mechanistic pathways led to 100 % selectivity for benzyl alcohol with an unprecedentedly high toluene conversion efficiency of >85 %.

    "abstract": "AbstractMXenes, a class of two-dimensional (2D) carbides and nitrides, have been used for many electrochemical reduction reactions owing to their electronic conductivity, specific surface area, and tunable surface chemistry. The performance of MXenes in catalyzing these reactions, specifically hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), is heavily dependent on the aforementioned properties, especially the surface chemistry. Currently, there are limited works that modulate the surface chemistry of nitride MXenes. In this presentation, I will present the effects of termination group modulation on the HER and ORR activity and stability of Ti4N3nitride MXene in alkaline medium. The Ti4N3MXene was synthesized via molten salt etching and delaminated using four different delamination agents namely tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), water (H2O), and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH). Findings from FTIR show that all have -O-, -OH, and -F terminations but EDS and XPS show that DMSO-delaminated Ti4N3has higher -F coverage, whereas TMAOH, TBAOH, and H2O-delaminated Ti4N3have predominantly oxygen terminations, -O- and -OH. In terms of HER activity, the delamination process does not affect onset potential as all had an onset close to -0.50 V vs RHE. However, after 18 hours of chronopotentiometry, the HER performance of each Ti4N3material increased differently – H2O > TBAOH = TMAOH > DMSO. We attribute this to the predominant -O- and -OH basal plane coverage which act as the HER active sites. For ORR activity, DMSO-delaminated Ti4N3had the most positive onset at 0.78 V and the greatest current retention with 83.6% after 18 hours chronoamperometry. This is in agreement with computational data of other MXene catalysts, where ORR favors MXenes with higher -F surface coverage. These results provide a framework for the exploration of the surface tuning of nitride MXenes for its advancement in fuel cell and water splitting applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTransition metal carbides (TMC) have long been heralded as inexpensive substitutes for Pt-group metals (PGMs) owing to similarities in chemical activity and electronic structure. TMCs offer vast catalyst design space owing to their particle-size-dependent polymorphism, tunable non-stoichiometric composition, and phase-dependent catalytic activity. Compared to Pt-group-based catalysts, TMCs exhibit higher stability and resistance to corrosion in their electrochemical operation, thus making them attractive low-cost electrocatalysts for sustainable energy generation and conversion. Unlike PGMs, TMCs are very oxophilic, which may limit their catalytic efficiency in oxidation and electrooxidation reactions due to the blocking of the catalytic sites by O* species. Contrary to this expectation, recent experimental findings reveal the significant co-catalytic activity of TMCs in the electrooxidation of methanol[1], ethanol, and formic acid[2]. The underlying mechanism for this unusual catalytic activity remains elusive.In this work, we employ a combination of density functional theory (DFT),ab initiothermodynamics, and reaction rate theory to unravel the source of TMC catalytic activity in oxidation reactions. We investigate a model reaction system, namely formic acid electrooxidation on the meta-stable α-MoC1-xphase, which was selected based on its reported excellent catalytic activity in low-temperature water-gas shift and methanol oxidation. The kinetics-cognizant surface Pourbaix diagram that we developed revealsin situsurface modification at varying electrochemical conditions. The origin of α-MoC1-xhigh catalytic activity is attributed to unique oxycarbide motifs which weaken otherwise strong surface-adsorbate interactions as supported by the calibrated Bader charge analysis and energy decomposition analysis. We hypothesize that this counterintuitive promotional effect ofin situ-deposited surface oxygen may be present in a range of electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reactions on other TMCs.References:[1] L Lin et al., Nature544(7648), 80 (2017).[2] M Yin et al., Journal of Power Sources219, 106 (2012).",

    "abstract": "AbstractOxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an exothermic, direct process to obtain light alkenes. ODH is a potential alternative for the conventional cracking-based processes, provided the product over-oxidation is addressed. The extent of over-oxidation can be reduced if CO2is used as a mild oxidant, though alkane conversion and product selectivity are still challenging. This combined experimental and theoretical work studies the CO2-assisted ODH of light alkanes (C2H6and C3H8) over ceria and Ni modified ceria-based catalysts. The catalysts were synthesized using impregnation, hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods. The catalysts were characterized using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) studies. These studies confirmed the formation of the crystallographic structure and morphology of the bare and modified catalyst, and the weight percent of Ni loaded. The electronic features will be studied using X-Ray photoelectron (XPS), Raman, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analyses. Plane-wave-based periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the CO2-assisted alkane ODH over a representative ceria nanoparticle-supported Ni catalyst system (Ni10/CeO1.89(111)). The oxygen vacancies present in the vicinity of the Ni-O-Ce interfacial sites of Ni10/CeO1.89(111)facilitate CO2adsorption (Eads= -1.68 eV). CO2further gets activated over the Ni cluster and forms CO* and active O* species, of which the O* is one of the active species among the other active oxygens of the ceria surface that activates the C-H bond of alkane. DFT studies in conjugation with theab-initiothermodynamics calculations predicted a 0.43 monolayer (ML) coverage of dissociated CO2(CO*+O*) over Ni10/CeO1.89(111) surface at typical propane ODH conditions (T = 773K and = 0.37 atm). Detailed propane ODH and representative overoxidation mechanistic studies are being done on this system. The developed mechanisms will further be validated usingin-situDRIFTS analyses.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPt-based bimetallic catalysts with doping metals such as Sn and Zn and tuned particle sizes have been synthesized on various supports to improve the selectivity and stability for propane (C3H8) dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene (C3H6). Among them, Pt subnanometer clusters recently emerged to exhibit superior PDH performance, including high activity and selectivity, and good stability. Considering the tremendous interest in atomically dispersed and sub-nanometer metallic catalysts on oxide supports, our work aims to develop structure-property relationships. Here, the roles of Pt nuclearity and doping metals, Sn and Zn, on activity and selectivity are elucidated, based on the investigation of PDH mechanism on Ptxand PtxSnyclusters on γ-alumina (Al2O3) PtxZnyclusters on silicalite-1 zeolite, and on extended surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling (MKM).The Ptxclusters are prone to sintering, and their stability is improved with the addition of Sn and Zn. On Al2O3(110), the Ptxactivity changes non-monotonically with cluster size. Pt1presents the most favorable dehydrogenation barriers, but its PDH rate is highly limited by the blocking of sites by hydrogen. A volcano-like activity-nuclearity relation is found, with Pt2being the most active cluster. Increased Pt nuclearity beyond x=2 leads to lower rates due to increased dehydrogenation barriers. Moderate addition of Sn depresses the Pt activity, whereas PtxSnyclusters with a Pt:Sn ratio of 1:1 become inactive. As a result of an activity-stability tradeoff, the Pt3Sn1cluster exhibits good activity with improved stability compared to Pt3and Pt2. While Sn promotes propylene desorption, propane hydrogenolysis to C1 and C2 species on single Pt atoms and small Ptxand PtxSnyclusters is unfavorable. Like Sn, Zn improves Pt stability and inhibits Pt activity. Finally, Zn and Sn are compared, and the differences are elucidated.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConverting methane to value-added chemicals is widely regarded as an energy-efficient and eco-friendly use of natural gas. However, the difficulty in breaking the robust C–H bonds of methane and controlling subsequent reactions that govern product selectivity have hindered the adoption of methane-based chemicals. Studies have shown that IrO2(110) is highly reactive for methane activation at low temperatures (< 100 K) but mainly produces complete oxidation products (CO2and H2O) [1]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that CH4molecules form strong dative bonds with coordinatively unsaturated Ir atoms (Ircus), and the desorption of the dative-bound CH4requires more energy than its activation. While rutile TiO2(110) is almost inert for this process, it is isostructural to IrO2, suggesting the possibility of synthesizing mixtures of IrO2and TiO2. Similarly, RuO2(110) can form mixed metal oxides with IrO2, providing additional control over the Ir content. In this work, we aim to elucidate the effects of Ir isolation using DFT calculations to control methane activation on Ir-doped RuO2and TiO2catalysts. We assess the binding energies of CH4*, CH3*, H*, CO*, O*, OH*, and H2O* on these surfaces. Furthermore, we contrast potential methane activation mechanisms to form products such as C2H4, CH2O, and CO2. Our data suggest that binding energies of species on isolated Ir within TiO2surfaces are more exothermic than those on pure IrO2surfaces and much more exothermic than those on pure TiO2surfaces. While the formation of CO2on pure IrO2surfaces requires the diffusion of C-derived species from one Ircussite to the next, isolated Ir within TiO2surfaces prevents this diffusion. Therefore, well-dispersed Ir single atoms on TiO2surfaces may be viable candidates for cost-effective methane conversion.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAs we transition away from the use of petroleum, it will become necessary for chemical industry to find alternative ways to produce platform chemicals. Methane (CH4) is a molecule that could be upgraded into platform chemicals, but direct conversion technologies are needed. Methane activation is quite challenging due to the stable nature of this symmetric molecule; catalyst design first focuses on the need to break the first C-H bond of methane to allow for further reaction. Single atom catalysts (SACs) can selectively activate methane for further conversion, such as through nonoxidative C-C coupling processes. The rationale selection of SAC-support combination to facilitate C-H dissociative adsorption remains unclear. Here, we probe the effect of support on the catalytic activity of Pt SACs for methane activation using density functional theory (DFT). Depending on the choice of support, the energy barrier for methane activation can vary from barrierless to 1 eV, despite use of the same Pt single atom catalyst. The activation barrier depends on a variety of factors including coordination environment, Pt oxidation state, energetic and spatial location of frontier orbitals. The supported Pt atom oxidation state plays an especially important role in dictating the Pt adatom activity. Generally, neutrally charged Pt adatoms are better at activating methane than either positive or negatively charged species, though this correlation is imperfect due as the additional descriptors also impact reaction energetics. The DFT dataset on Pt includes a series of doped and undoped oxide supports, and extension to other SAC/support combinations is discussed in the search for descriptors that predict methane conversion activity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCatalytic cracking is a key reaction in refining industry and is often catalyzed using microporous acid catalysts, specifically, silicon/aluminum catalysts known as zeolites. Within zeolites the framework aluminum atoms are charge balanced by Bronsted acid sites, while rare earth species are introduced to increase the hydrothermal stability of the structure. These extra framework species also have an impact on the reaction’s turnover frequency and selectivity. However, the exact role of these extra framework species (e.g., Al, Si, La,...) remains unclear and under debate. In this study, we report density functional theory calculations to reveal the specific roles of extra framework aluminum, lanthanum, and cerium (Ce3+) within MFI zeolite using propane cracking as a probe reaction. The enthalpy and entropy of each step is calculated. We find that the presence of extra framework species stabilizes the transition states by redistributing the charges of the protonated transition states and that such an electronic effect can be tuned by changing the nature of the extra framework structures. This work thus provides fundamental insights for designing the active sites and their local environment for promoting the cracking activity and selectivity (cracking with respect to dehydrogenation).",

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon materials have been studied as potential catalysts for methane conversion reactions.1Recently, it was determined that a variety of catalyst materials, after coking to the point of complete coverage, were still able to catalyze the non-oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) reaction.2Previous experimental and computational work suggest that defects within the carbon structure, such as carbon vacancies in the surface or edges that are formed from sheet separation, resulting in individual carbon atoms with an electron-deficient valence structure, could act as the active sites in these reactions.1,3To test these hypotheses, we employ surface free energy and phase coexistence diagrams to determine the stability of model carbon-monolayer defects at partial hydrogen pressures appropriate for NOCM. These diagrams are generated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to determine the minimum grand free energy of defects with different levels of hydrogen passivation as a function of temperature and pressure. The results suggest that all defect models are most stable when fully passivated, and hydrogen binding to carbon atoms adjacent to vacancies renders their valence structure electronically satisfied. These structures, in turn, form the basis for a detailed analysis of the mechanisms, including thermodynamic energy changes and activation barriers, for NOCM. The results suggest that hydrogen-passivated sites can be active for NOCM and point to likely candidates for catalytically active defect structures on graphene-derived carbon surfaces.References:(1) Muradov, N., Catal.

    "abstract": "AbstractCentral towards using liquid organic hydrogen carriers like the toluene(TOL)/methylcyclohexane(MCH) pair, is identifying dehydrogenation catalysts that selectively dissociate C-H bonds. Promoters like sulfur modify the active sites of Pt such that TOL desorption is favored over competitive C-C cleavage to benzene [1]. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we determine how sulfur modifies the morphologies of Pt nanoparticles and how such structural modifications, alter the rate and selectivity of MCH dehydrogenation. We formulate a graph-based model that predicts the surface energies (errors < ~ 5 meV/Å2) of crystal planes decorated with S* having any arbitrary coverage and configuration. Leveraging this graph-based model, we screen > 105configurations on (111), (100), and (211) surfaces to identify the most thermodynamically stable S* coverages and configurations. Equilibrium morphologies of metal nanoparticles covered by S* are then determined using Wulff constructions, which reveal that S* restructures the nanoparticle (Figure 1b) such that the densities of terrace sites (selective sites) increase at the expense of step edges. Upon determining the nanoparticle structures, we then elucidate the MCH dehydrogenation pathway to TOL and to the undesired product, benzene. We consider sulfur-free Pt-55 cuboctahedral nanoparticles as a reference catalyst (Figure 1c) and compare reactivity and selectivity trends against S*- decorated Pt nanoparticles, (111), and (100) surfaces. Through this reaction pathway analysis, we discuss how S*: (a) blocks low-coordinated metal sites which promote benzene formation, (b) weakens adsorption of MCH dehydrogenation reaction intermediates, and (c) influences C-H dissociation pathways. Insights from the reaction pathway analysis are compared with experimentally measured rates and selectivity on both sulfur-free and sulfur-modified Pt nanoparticles. This work introduces an approach to quantify how promoters like sulfur alter nanoparticle morphology and their reactivity.[1] Okada Y., Extended abstracts of the 9th Tokyo Conference on Advanced Catalytic Science and Technology, Fukuoka, KL14, (2022).",

    "abstract": "AbstractZeolites are porous aluminosilicate materials that are commonly used as catalysts. The active sites in zeolites form when substituting Al3+for Si4+, which introduces an anionic charge that is frequently balanced by H+to produce a Brønsted acid site. Changes in the proximity or location of Al within zeolites can change turnover rates (per H+) for reactions like methanol dehydration [1, 2]. Despite its importance, the factors that govern Al distribution remain undetermined. Recent work suggested that a combination of the relative stability of the crystallographic position of the Al in a framework and a sum of coulombic interactions between cationic organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) and Al influenced Al placement [3]. Here, we enumerate all unique Al arrangements in CHA zeolites for Si/Al=5–35 (1–6 Al substitutions in a 36 T-atom unit cell). There is only one symmetrically unique Al position in CHA, but the number of unique structures increases with each Al substitution (Fig. 1a). This example shows that, even in high-symmetry frameworks, Al positioning drastically alters the number of symmetrically equivalent structures and illustrates how brute-force introduction of Al without removing duplicate structures can make computational studies combinatorically infeasible. We compute the energies of these arrangements with and without cationic OSDAs balancing framework anions using density functional theory (DFT). Energies of structures without OSDAs depend linearly on the sum of inverse Al-Al distances in the unit cell (Fig. 1b), indicating that predominantly coulombic interactions govern the relative stability of Al arrangements. Finally, we use these data and similar calculations with cationic OSDAs present to train a graph neural network model to evaluate the stabilities of Al arrangements with cations present without costly DFT calculations.References[1]Chem.

    "abstract": "AbstractZeolite ZSM-5 is a commonly used catalyst in many (petro)chemical processes such as methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC); however, the synthesis of ZSM-5 is highly prone to the generation of defects, which can range from residual amorphous material or crystallographic dislocations to non-framework or extra-framework Al species. Minimizing these defects is a subject of interest owing to their correlation with the onset of catalyst deactivation. Conventional strategies to produce defect-free ZSM-5 crystals involve bottom-up syntheses with fluoride ions (using HF or NH4F), or post-synthesis treatment with mild acids. Here, we will discuss how defects are more prevalent in hierarchical ZSM-5 (MFI-type) materials than previously reported in literature. For this study, we prepared five classes of nanosized/hierarchical zeolites that include nanosheets (ca. 3 nm thickness), self-pillared pentasils (ca. 3 nm thickness), nanoparticles (ca. 20 nm), finned zeolites (ca. 30 nm fins), and coreshells (ca. 10 nm shell thickness). Using MTH as a benchmark reaction, our studies reveal that catalyst performance can be dramatically improved via post-synthesis treatments to reduce defects, which include so-called annealing wherein crystals are subjected to a saturated siliceous solution at high-temperature. The impact of post-synthesis treatment on ZSM-5 catalyst performance is highly dependent on the composition (i.e. Si/Al ratio) and the nature of defects in each sample. Our findings reveal that the removal of defects from ZSM-5 catalysts result in as low as 3-fold to as high as 10-fold increases in turnover number compared to their as-synthesized counterparts. To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts, highlighting (i) syntheses among the most highly cited in literature that are more prone to defect formation and (ii) the class of ZSM-5 hierarchical/nano-sized materials yielding the best MTH performance.",

    "abstract": "AbstractChabazite (CHA) synthesized with N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantyl ammonium (TMAda+) as sole organic structure directing agent (OSDA) can access a wide range of Si/Al ratios. Assuming a perfect CHA lattice with one OSDA per cage, charge-balance implies a Si/Al ratio of 11 if each CHA since each TMAda+is charge compensated by a framework Al. Previous work indicates that the energetics of TMAda+interaction with an Al-decorated CHA framework rationalizes observed Al siting preferences. Here we extend this approach to interrogate the influence of TMAda+on Al and siloxy defects using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). We explore over a range of relative densities and distributions of Al and defects over the CHA lattice. We find that siloxy defects can adopt different configurations in which three silanol protons point toward different framework oxygens. Relative energies show that TMADA+ does not bias the incorporation of defects over Al (or vice-versa), other than to bias towards distributions that minimize the distance between the positive charge on the OSDA and the negative charge on the framework. This is consistent with observed characterization of CHA materials at various compositions when synthesized with TMAda+.",

    "abstract": "AbstractZeolites are nanoporous materials that are heavily used in industrial catalysis and separations. Despite their vast structural and chemical diversity, limited structures and compositions are accessible due to strict synthesis windows that require substantial experimental effort to determine. A key driver of selectivity in zeolite synthesis is organic structure directing agents (OSDAs). OSDAs template specific crystalline structures (frameworks) during crystallization, but are challenging to designa prioriand often costly to synthesize. In this work, we illustrate a fully computational work flow for the design of de novo OSDAs. A machine learning model is trained on over half a million binding affinities between molecules and zeolites and used to screen over a million different quaternary and di-quaternary molecules—enumerated from commercially available building blocks—for potential zeolite-OSDA matches, an exploration orders of magnitude larger than previous efforts [1]. An automated docking pipeline, benchmarked in previous work [2], verifies the binding affinities for promising molecules. Finally, shape and energy metrics are used to curate a final pool of synthesizable OSDA candidates for a targeted framework. We demonstrate the capability of this computational workflow through two syntheses of cage-based zeolites with previously inaccessible Si/Al ratios using novel OSDAs. We also highlight some insights into structural similarities between frameworks from a molecular perspective using the predicted binding energies. This work demonstrates the capability of using surrogate models and intelligent screening to vastly expand the space for realizable, novel material design in a cost-efficient manner.References:[1]Proc.

    "abstract": "AbstractAluminosilicate zeolites are used as Brønsted acid catalysts in their H-forms. Carbonaceous deposits accumulate within zeolite pores requiring oxidative regeneration protocols at high temperatures and generating water during combustion reactions. Exposure to water-containing environments (~10 kPa H2O) at high temperatures (>823 K) causes hydrothermal aging, characterized by the hydrolysis of framework Al-(OH)-Si connectivities, among others, and eventually the removal of framework Al (Alf) atoms to form extraframework Al (Alex) species in dealumination events. It has been proposed that the total Al content (e.g., Si/Al),1Al distribution (e.g., among different T-sites)2,3and structural defects (e.g., silanol groups)4influence dealumination kinetics (723-873 K, 5-35 kPa H2O) on H-form MFI zeolites. However, the kinetics and mechanisms of framework dealumination, and their dependence on material properties, including Al density, local arrangement, and crystallite size, are difficult to determine in low symmetry frameworks such as MFI. Here, we synthesized H-form CHA zeolite samples with varying Al content (Si/Al = 12-22), 6-MR paired Al site arrangement (2-28%), and crystallite size (0.18-1.1 mm) at fixed composition (Si/Al = 12-15) using previously reported methods5,6and exposed them to hydrothermal aging conditions (923 K, 10 kPa H2O) for varying amounts of time. The number of Alfsites after each treatment was determined by quantifying the number of H+sites by NH3TPD7, and used to determine kinetic models for Alfremoval as a function of time and material properties (active site density, distribution, crystallite size). Kinetic values measured were compared across samples to provide insight into the influence of zeolite properties on the dealumination kinetics of CHA zeolites. Altogether, these results provide new approaches to quantify the kinetics of dealumination on zeolites of varying material properties, to gain fundamental insights into the reactions and mechanisms that govern dealumination under hydrothermal aging conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSustainable production of chemicals will require creating highly active catalysts for upgrading biomass using key reactions, including Aldol chemistry. Traditionally, Aldol chemistry is catalyzed by enzymes that use acid-base cooperativity to form C-C bonds. These cooperative interactions can be translated to heterogeneous aminosilica SBA-15, which are promising candidates for these reactions.Unfortunately, there is a limited understanding of structure-function behavior for these aminosilica catalysts, preventing further optimization for this chemistry. In this work, site quantification experiments are used to establish structure-function relationships for negligible-micropore (NMP) SBA-15. In contrast to widely accepted assumptions that these sites have equal contributions, we have discovered that three different types of sites exist with different catalytic contributions. Furthermore, the relative amount of each type of site may be tuned to optimize SBA-15 for Aldol chemistry. To improve the viability of NMP-SBA-15 for industrial applications, recycling tests are performed to assess how the catalytic sites and capabilities change upon catalyst reuse. It is demonstrated that high-activity sites are transformed to low-activity sites after initial use, resulting in decreased catalytic performance for subsequent use. To combat this, three possible reactivation methods were investigated and proposed: (1) toluene pre-treatment, (2) potassium carbonate solution treatment, and (3) water treatment. Preliminary results of the second reactivation show that the intermediates on the catalyst surface might be removed. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of a molecular understanding of cooperative interactions at catalytic sites to improve catalyst performance and stability.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPhosphorus-containing catalysts have showed extraordinary selectivities to the desired products in several biomass upgrading conversions, e.g. dehydra-decyclization of cyclic ethers, due to their weaker acid strengths as compared with traditional solid acid catalysts.1However, one limitation of these weakly acidic catalysts is their low catalytic activity. Therefore, catalyst that overcomes the activity limitation while maintaining a high product selectivity is expected. Herein, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity of phosphorus-impregnated zeolite (P-BEA) is enormously enhanced in the presence of water and basic molecules like alkylamine, as probed by alcohol dehydration and alkylamine Hofmann elimination. While treatment with water alone increased the rate of isopropanol dehydration (~7×), co-feeding a sufficiently basic molecule such as tert-butylamine (TBA) led to a ~ 300 factor rate increase (Figure 1A). A combination of in-situ kinetic titration and infrared characterization revealed that the Brønsted acid site density increased by two orders of magnitude when the catalyst was treated with TBA and a high partial pressure of water Pwater(Figure 1B). Such enhancement was found to be completely reversible by annealing the catalyst in helium flow, and the degree of rate enhancement was found to be positively correlated with the water partial pressure in the vapor phase feed after the initial activation.31P solid state NMR and XANES revealed phosphorus species with various degrees of oligomerization on the activated P-BEA, demonstrating the activity enhancement was due to the hydrolysis of highly polymerized phosphorous species.1.

    "abstract": "AbstractChemical reactions lie at the heart of processes designed to meet our growing energy and material needs. The first step towards designing and optimizing chemical reactions involves identification of underlying mechanisms and quantification of rates. Quantum chemistry methods along with theories such as transition state theory (TST) are indispensable for this purpose and have played a pivotal role in elucidating mechanisms in recent decades. While widely successful, conventional TST is relatively simplistic and can lead to inaccurate rates for many classes of reactions. Alternative, more accurate rate theories such as variational transition state theory (VTST) with multidimensional tunneling are well-established but incur exceptionally high computational costs which limits their widespread use. We aim to lower these costs to enhance reliability of rate predictions by adapting algorithms typically used in signal processing. I will present our algorithm – polynomial variety-based matrix completion (PVMC) - that leverages matrix completion methods, widely used to recover signals from noisy, incomplete data, to recover otherwise expensive second derivatives of energy for points on the minimum energy path of a reaction. The algorithm is up to an order of magnitude cheaper than traditional VTST approaches, and we demonstrate its utility in practical problems in catalysis with enzyme-inspired CH activation chemistry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) could contribute to a circular economy that will curtail unsustainable fossil fuel burning and decrease future greenhouse gas emissions. The lack of practical electrocatalysts impedes its further development. Rational design of efficient, selective CO2R electrocatalysts necessitates a reliable mechanistic analysis on the most efficacious catalysts thus far identified, namely, copper (Cu).Becausein situelectrochemical mechanism determination by experimental techniques remains out of reach, such mechanistic analysis typically is conducted using density functional theory (DFT). However,the DFT exchange-correlation approximations most often used to model such reactions unfortunately engender a foundational error, predicting the wrong adsorption site for CO (a key CO2R intermediate) on metal surfaces (including Cu), casting doubt on previous DFT-predicted CO2R kinetics. Our work rigorously elucidates reaction mechanisms involved in electrochemical CO2R on Cu, by means of state-of-the-art embedded correlated wavefunction theory, which corrects for exchange-correlation errors inherent in conventional DFT approximations. We examine competing carbon monoxide reduction steps via proton-coupled electron transfer path and multiple C-C coupling steps towards generation of multi-carbon hydrocarbon products. We show for the first time on a practical electrocatalyst how crucial it can be to use advanced theory that goes beyond standard DFT to properly describe rate-limiting steps in electrochemistry.

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrocatalysis is a promising technology due to its conversion of electrical to chemical energy at ambient reaction conditions while controlling the selectivity and kinetics using an applied voltage. Despite its promising potential, the rational design of electrocatalysts is difficult due to the complex interplay of the electrode-electrolyte interface with the catalyst, impacting the kinetics of electrochemical reactions. Theoretical modeling of these systems is not trivial due to the large length and time scales of electrocatalytic systems, which is computationally daunting for “exact” computational models to capture the complexity of solvation and electrification. While more approximate approaches are more computationally tractable, they lack predictability and ability discern results between unphysical model parameters, questioning these predictions.We introduce a computational efficient compartmentalized approach that can be used to model electrochemical activation barriers, reaction energetics, and equilibrium adsorption potentials within the EDL while discerning the choices utilized in our model. Our model utilizes the advantages of density functional theory (DFT) and force-field molecular dynamics (FF-MD) methods to incorporate electrification and solvation within the EDL. DFT calculations are utilized to represent the local electronic structure of the adsorbate on the electrocatalysts with the inclusion of explicit H2O to represent micro solvation. We incorporate electrode double-layer theory described by a Helmholtz model to incorporate electrification within the EDL with the advantage of selecting two discernable model parameters, dielectric constant and width of the EDL. We lastly incorporate a FF-MD model of the electrode-electrolyte that can model the extended dynamic solvation effects and electrification outside of the DFT length scale while rationally informing the parameters of our EDL model. Our model predicts that larger dipole moment changes along the reaction path indicate larger magnitude of EDL effects on activation barriers and equilibrium adsorption potentials, predicting that these systems are more sensitive to the model parameters used.",

    "abstract": "AbstractComputational predictions of structures and chemical reactivities of molecules and materials are limited by the high cost of state-of-the-artab initiomethods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and coupled cluster theory. The tight binding (TB) approximation reduces the computational burden by replacing many complicated integrals with simplified empirical functional forms. Such integral approximations, however, involve data-fitted parameters that often sacrifice accuracy and suffer from poor transferability across the chemical space. Consequently, applications of TB models in chemistry remain restricted, despite the significant demand for low-cost energy calculators that can accelerate computational discoveries.Previously, we introduced a non-empirical tight binding model (NTB) that is free of parameters. The model generalizes the Hückel electronic structure problem and is based on a new ansatz of atom-centered, non-interacting, hydrogenic electron states, which we refer to as H-ansatz. Surprisingly, the method surpasses the accuracy of Kohn-Sham DFT for certain molecules. For H2, NTB exhibits absolute errors of 0.002 Å, 0.08 eV/atom, and 13 cm-1in equilibrium bond length, electronic binding energy, and vibrational frequency with respect to experimentally derived values. Remarkably, NTB achieves this accuracy using an on-the-fly-optimized minimal basis set and no parameters.In this work, we discuss our efforts toward the generalization of the NTB theory to larger Hxsystems and extension toward main group elements. We report sensitivity testing of the total energy to different physically motivated forms of the H-ansatz Hamiltonian and evaluate the connection of NTB to the empirical electronegativity equalization principle. Finally, we assess the viability of NTB in calculating energy barriers of model chemical reactions. We anticipate that development of NTB will enable rapid characterization of a wide array of materials and reaction mechanisms, paving a way toward more rapid discoveries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe heat of formation (HoF) of adsorbates is an important parameter in microkinetic modeling since it quantifies the stability of intermediates on the catalyst surface. These values are usually derived from DFT and exhibit drastic differences compared to experimental values. Instead of using prohibitively expensive higher-level of theory methods, it is possible to use error cancellation techniques, well-established tools in the gas-phase community but hitherto unknown in catalysis. In this study, we propose a novel methodology to compute HoF of adsorbates more accurately by exploiting error cancellation.The connectivity-based hierarchy (CBH) is an automated approach that decomposes a target species into fragments that conserve the bonding environment and hybridization of the target to various extents. These fragments are then combined in reference reactions that conserve e.g. bond-types (isodesmic reaction). Errors from DFT cancel out due to the configurational similarity and hybridization of the species on both sides of the reference reaction, resulting in a more accurate HoF.The CBH method, originally developed for organic gas-phase molecules, is extended to handle the complex configurational space of adsorbates, including physisorbed and multidentate adsorbates. The CBH method is applied to a database of adsorbates on Pt(111) with up to 4 heavy atoms. Available experimental HoF for the isodesmic bond types are used as reference species, which links experiments with theory. Computed HoF from the CBH method with a range of DFT functionals are within chemical accuracy from experiments for CH3CH2CH3* and *OCH3, unlike conventional methods (see Figure). More accurate HoF of adsorbates is expected to have significant consequences on the elucidation of reaction mechanisms and multiscale modeling. The method is a breakthrough in creating a unified thermochemical network for adsorbates as it combines experiments with ab-initio results. Additionally, the developed methodology is generic and universally applicable to other metals, oxides, and zeolites.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe accurate description of shifts in the d-bands center of metallic systems during alloying and adsorption is a crucial factor in predicting their catalytic activity trends. However, for complex compositions such as nanoparticles or Van der Waals heterostructures, computing electronic properties through ab-initio methods such as density functional theory (DFT) is computationally very expensive or, with increasing system size, unfeasible.Tight-binding (TB) approaches such as the self-charge-consistent density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB) method offer an appealing alternative, reducing these demanding tasks to seconds or minutes even for large systems, with a negligible loss in accuracy. With an average performance of three orders of magnitude faster than DFT, SCC-DFTB allows for work on system sizes up to the nanoscale while still retaining ab-initio information.Our research has resulted in the development database of so-called Slater-Koster files that contain the TB overlap matrices describing the electronic information of every possible d-element pairing. These sets of parameters, when incorporated into the DFTB+ software, accurately describe the density of states and band structures of any (bi-)metallic alloy in a matter of minutes. During our contribution at the conference, we will explain how our established TB routine enables the immediate identification of shifts in the d-bands center during subsurface alloying and the adsorption of O, H, C, and N species.We are confident that our method represents an important breakthrough for the computational catalysis community, as it guarantees transferability to complex systems that would otherwise be inaccessible to any other ab-initio method.",

The use of carbon-free electrification is a way of decarbonizing the chemical industry. In this work, modeling design of an electrified steam methane reformer (SMR) is investigated. The SMR features strong endothermic reactions, and conventionally driven by the combustion of natural gas. Herein, induction heating generated by an alternating magnetic field is applied to provide a non-contact heat source to the catalyst sites. Among different induction heating mechanisms, eddy current and hysteresis were considered for heating purpose. A first principle mathematical model was developed by considering the fluid mass, energy, momentum balances as well as diffusion-reaction, both inside (catalyst domain) and outside (bulk gas phase) of the catalyst pellet. Different scale of models was built by considering one-dimensional or two-dimensional model, accounting for diffusion or dispersion, and heterogeneous or pseudo-homogeneous reactions, among others. The results indicate that the electrified reformer is more compact, energy-efficient, and has faster dynamics than the current reformers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogen is an excellent energy carrier to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy and the green hydrogen generated by electrolysis is the cleanest candidate.1-2Department of Energy in the United States has set \"1 dollar ($) per kilogram (kg) in one-decade\" cost and 80-thousand-hour durability targets for clean hydrogen production. The current price of green hydrogen (5-6 $/kg) must be lowered by reducing electricity and electrocatalyst expense. The increased capacity of renewable energy leads to a significant price reduction in electricity.3The next task is to cheapen the material cost of catalysts. Because various non-precious metal materials and components are stable in high pH environments, hydroxide exchange membrane electrolyzers (HEMELs) can use non-precious metal catalysts in both electrodes. However, the weakly adhered catalyst layers in HEMELs always suffer from continuous gas generation and bubble detachment disturbance, resulting in a short lifespan.Herein, we report a work about a novel cathodic electrode preparation technique to improve the activity and durability of non-precious metal based HEMELs. Propylene glycol is added into the conventional water and alcohol solvent system to enhance the adherence among Ni-Mo/Engineered catalyst support catalyst (purchased from Pajarito Powder company) agglomerates. An additional carbon layer configuration is designed between the gas diffusion and catalyst layers to alleviate wash-off and transfer-to-membrane issues during tests. This HEMEL with Ni-Fe-OOH anode4and Ni-Mo/Engineered catalyst support cathode can achieve a 500 mA cm-2current density at 1.8 V under pure water. The optimized electrode structure can prevent the detachment of catalysts during continuous operation and demonstrate good voltage stability at 200 mA cm-2current density for above 100 h. The role of propylene glycol in the catalyst-ink formulation and the contribution of the additional carbon layer to water/gas transport efficiency will be systematically explored. This work highlights the importance of electrode design for achieving highly active and stable non-precious metal based HEMELs, and sheds light on developing advanced electrode structures for other electrochemical devices.Oliveira, A.

    "abstract": "AbstractAs water scarcity issues become exacerbated by climate change and population growth, an evident solution is to enlarge potable water production via desalinization. Unfortunately, this technology leads to major environmental side effects that result from the discharge of concentrated seawater (reject brine) into neighboring bodies of seawater, land, or evaporation ponds. The long-term impact of this practice on marine life is still unknown, but the brine's high temperature and salinity levels could be devastating. On the other hand, reject brine contains minerals and salts like calcium, magnesium, and sodium chloride that can be harvested and reutilized by other industries. A promising approach to treat reject brine is to use membraneless electrolyzers, which are well-suited for operation with highly conductive liquid electrolytes and avoid the need for membranes by controlling fluid flow to separate anode and cathode products before they can cross over to opposing effluent streams. They can operate in a wide range of pH environments and simultaneously generate acid and base; however, the lack of separator can result in high levels of product crossover if the electrolyzer is not designed or operated properly. This issue can be addressed by operating at higher flow rates, which can push bubbles away from the centerline separating the two electrodes, thereby minimizing crossover. However, higher flow rates also dilute the generated product. In this study, we investigate the trade-offs between crossover, cell voltage, and the concentration of generated acid and base with a combination of electroanalytical measurements,in situhigh-speed videography, pH dye experiments, and modeling. Additionally, the distribution of catalysts was varied to control where the product was generated and further reduce crossover. Our study demonstrates that placing the active catalyst in the opposite face of the electrodes increases current utilization by up to 40% and improves catalyst stability. Further work involves the scale-up and optimization of the reactor design.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogen is traditionally produced through steam methane reforming (SMR) where natural gas and steam are reacted at high temperatures to produce a mixture of CO2, CO, and H2from which H2must be separated. Due to the multiple reaction and separation steps involved and the need for heat recovery integration, SMR must be conducted at large scales in centralized plants to reach profitable efficiencies. Alternatively, water electrolyzers can be used to electrochemically produce H2from water. However, the minimum energy required to produce H2from electrolysis is still almost seven times higher than from SMR. A promising alternative process is the use of proton conducting ceramic BaZr0.8-x-yCexYyO3-δ(BZCY) membranes to perform SMR electrochemically. Combining the SMR process with these proton conductive ceramics enables H2separation and compression to be integrated into the reaction process through electrochemical pumping of the protons. The removal of H2also provides the benefit of shifting the equilibrium of the SMR reaction so that nearly complete conversion of methane can be reached. Additionally, the separation and compression of H2generates heat directly in the membrane that can be balanced with the energy consumed by the endothermic SMR reaction to provide micro-scale heat integration [1]. This technology has the potential to transform how H2is generated, and by pairing other reactions with the separated protons, alternative and more direct pathways to produce valuable chemicals such as ammonia can be developed [2].In this study, we present the details of a system developed in our lab to test the performance of these proton conducting ceramic membranes and present the results of our study under a wide range of pressure, temperature, and gas compositions. Detailed considerations of the system design include pressures up to 50 bar, temperatures up to 900oC, and electrical connections to the membrane. The details of how sensing and control were designed to allow for automated data collection are also discussed [3]. Additionally, results from tests performed on membrane assemblies provided by CoorsTek Membrane Sciences are presented for proton pumping and SMR. Lastly, the data from these tests is used to develop a reduced order model that can be used to inform engineering decisions in larger scale system design.References:Malerød-Fjeld, H., Clark, D., Yuste-Tirados, I., Zanόn, R., Catalán-Martinez, D., Beeaff, D., Morejudo, S.

Electricity can be obtained from green sources thus lowering the CO2burden of the reactor that normally utilizes fixed heat flux generates by burning natural gas. The optimization of such reactor operating conditions, however, becomes more complex and laboratory experiments need to be performed in conjunction with the experiment optimization to account for the multitude of external variables (chiefly thermal heat vs electricity to generate plasma), the resulting performance parameters, such as generated H2amount, as well as sustainability constrains, such as the source of electricity used.In this presentation, we show a comprehensive plasma-enhanced catalytic dry methane reforming reactor analysis of experiments to obtain the optimal operating conditions with the objective to maximize H2production while minimizing the associated environmental impacts. In particular, variables explored included CO2/CH4ratio, gas flow, reactor temperature, plasma intensity and water vapor content. The response parameters included reactant conversion, H2produced, rate of reaction and carbon balance. Importantly, environmental impact calculations were also performed using Life Cycle Analysis to calculate environmental burden, in kg CO2equivalent using the laboratory data obtained during the experiments. These calculations resulted in a set of solutions that allowed to maximize H2production while minimizing their environmental impacts.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe chemical industry has been one of the major contributors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for nearly one third of global CO2emissions. Many of these industrial processes require the heating of volumetric reaction media to high temperatures, with applications ranging from the selective capture of gases (e.g., CO2, SO2, etc) and the production of fuels and chemicals (e.g., biomass decomposition, hydrogen and syngas generation, etc) to the processing of materials (e.g., baking of bricks, sintering of minerals, etc). One solution to mitigating these carbon emissions is to utilize renewable and clean electricity, instead of fossil fuels, to provide endothermic heat for these processes. Amongst the wide range of environmentally friendly electrification heating concepts currently being explored, inductive heating is an established method for clean, efficient, and rapid heating and is used industrially in the processing of raw iron and silicon materials. However, an underlying challenge to date is understanding how inductive heating can be adapted to heat volumetric media uniformly and its integration with different reactor configurations. An extensive and thorough understanding of the design of three-dimensional heating susceptors, catalyst integration with the susceptor, and co-design of power electronics with the susceptor are required.In this study, we discuss the potential for inductive heating to serve as an electrification heating solution for heating steam methane reforming catalytic reactors. Metallic open cell lattice susceptors were washcoated with the zirconia and impregnated with Ni solution to act as both heating susceptors and supported catalyst material. With a combination of analytic and numerical electromagnetic optimization, the lattice geometry was optimized to produce uniform volumetric heating across the susceptor, minimizing temperature gradients within the reactor and minimizing heat transfer limitations between the susceptor and catalyst. A focal point of our research effort was in addressing heating efficiency, which has been limited in prior studies by poor energy transfer efficiency between the magnetic coils and susceptors due to operation at low frequencies. In combination with parametric studies on the effects of circuit frequency and coil geometry on heating efficiency, we utilize a high frequency inductive heating scheme, based on megahertz frequency power electronics, to enable susceptor heating at near unity efficiencies. We evaluate the reactor system's performance through experiments at different residence time and temperature and experimentally demonstrate that operating the setup at MHz scale frequency can lead to heating efficiencies above 90%, comparable to resistive heating method.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe global hydrogen generation market, valued at USD 148 billion in 2021, is forecasted to reach USD 280 billion by 2030. This growth and demand for hydrogen is driven principally by ammonia and methanol production, and oil refining. The largest share of this market revenue comes from steam methane reforming (SMR). Compared to other commercial processes for generating hydrogen, SMR is currently the most economically attractive due to its high efficiency and low feedstock, production, and operational costs. However, SMR is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, emitting about 9 kg of CO2per kg H2produced. The GHG emissions are primarily a result of the use of natural gas combustion to supply the heat needed in SMR furnaces to drive the chemistry to high conversion. Therefore, in order for the hydrogen generation sector to significantly reduce its share of GHG emissions, the rapid development and deployment of sustainable low-carbon energy solutions are warranted.This study examines a potential decarbonization solution: electrification of SMR. We use a bench-scale electrified reformer that uses resistive heating as the heat source by applying direct electric current through a coiled high-resistance FeCrAl metal wire. The metal coils (0.5-mm o.d.; 40 cm in length; 3.13 ohm resistance) used were uncoated or coated with a Ni/zirconia catalyst. A feed stream comprised of steam and methane (4:1 molar ratio) and nitrogen at 190°C and 1 atm flows into a stainless-steel tube (45 mm i.d.) that houses the wire. The feed perpendicularly encounters the electrically-heated wire 100 mm downstream. Experiments are conducted at power settings in the range 50-90 W, corresponding to an estimated wire temperature range of 650-850°C. After condensing unreacted steam from the effluent exiting the reformer, FTIR analysis is used to detect and quantify for CO, CO2, and CH4.Results for the coated coil showed that power settings below 66 W yield low conversions (< 3.0%). However, for power greater than 66 W, an unusual step change in conversion occurred – 84% at 70 W increasing to 89% at 89 W. The ratio of CO to CO2increased from 0.77 at 58 W to 1.7 at 89 W. Experiments with the uncoated coil exhibited insignificant conversions (< 0.5%) between 50-90 W. This clearly demonstrated that the high conversions obtained were due to the catalytic activity of the coating. Though H2was not measured directly, we computed H2generation from the conversion, CO/CO2composition, and SMR chemistry – at the highest conversion, we obtained a value of 0.16 mol of H2generated per mol of feed mixture. This corresponds to USD 93 per kg H2.Our results show that under the experimental conditions examined in our study, electrification of SMR, albeit expensive in terms of H2production cost, is possible with high conversions. This will have significant relevance to the hydrogen generation sector as it makes attempts to reduce its carbon footprint. Further studies are ongoing to investigate ways to reduce the H2production cost and to gain an understanding of the step change behavior in conversion.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAbstract:With renewable electricity becoming a highly widespread and accessible form of energy, electrification of chemical processes presents one of the most promising transition paths to low carbon footprint manufacturing of chemicals. A large extent of chemical processes in industry are endothermic in nature and the necessary heat is currently provided by burning fossil fuels. The conversion of methane into acetylene has gained more attention in recent years and is one of the promising pathways to create acetylene. This conversion is favorable at high temperature (>19000C) at very low residence times (<1 millisec), which poses some challenges. The basic technology using an electric arc reactor, however, has been around for many decades [1]. Due to heterogeneity of the temperature and residence times, significant amounts of carbon is formed, which decreases the selectivity towards acetylene in conventional reactor concepts. The current work shows a novel reactor concept where necessary heat is provided directly via electricity (joule heating) for a high temperature chemical conversion of methane to acetylene [2]. The concept involves flow of methane through structured packing or obstacles of arranged mesh or wire structures directly heated by green electricity [fig.1]. Such concepts are also very recently published in literature for catalytic conversions [3-5]. However, a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based numerical simulations coupled with developed reaction kinetics shows optimal conversion and selectivity of methane to acetylene at the desired temperature and residence times, if these structures are arranged in a specific configuration. The concept also shows added advantage with respect to scale up, modularity, residence time distribution and lower pressure drop than conventional reactor concepts.High-Temperature Pyrolysis of Hydrocarbons. 1.

    "abstract": "AbstractFrom inelastic collisions between the energetic electrons and gas molecules, non-thermal plasma (NTP) produces reactive chemical environments (e.g., electrons, ions, radicals, and vibrationally-excited molecules) at temperatures where such species are thermally inaccessible. Integrating reactive NTP with heterogeneous catalysis has recently gained interest to enhance catalytic activities/selectivities and promote a novel chemical transformation that neither plasma nor catalysis could deliver individually. To better control plasma-catalyst coupling, it is important to understand the interaction between the NTP-activated species and a catalytic surface. In this work, we utilized a multi-modal spectroscopy tool combining polarization-modulation infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRAS), optical emission spectroscopy (OES), and mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate the interaction between NTP-activated CH4/N2species and model surfaces (Ni, Pd, Cu, Ag, Au, and SiO2) for C-N coupling. To minimize the plasma-phase interaction between CH4and N2, we introduce CH4/N2feed gas sequentially: (1) CH4-N2in sequence and (2) N2-CH4in sequence. We show that different sequences lead to CN signatures in OES spectra corresponding to C-N coupled products forming on a catalytic surface. The effects of different surfaces on the nature of surface-adsorbed C-N coupled products are further investigated with ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).",

    "abstract": "AbstractWe report pathways and timescales for reductive and oxidative conversion of plasma-derived N2species (N, N2(v)) using a combination of molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) measurements to enumerate densities of plasma-derived species and short contact time reactors with sub-millisecond residence times. For reduction of N2in Ar/N2/H2mixtures, rates and quantities of NH3formation correlate with rates and quantities of N consumption, indicating that NH3formation occurs from surface-mediated reactions involving N radicals. When densities of H and H2are sufficient, conversion of N to NH3is 100% selective over Fe, Ni, and Ag. Through MBMS-validated state-to-state vibrational kinetic modeling, we show that N2(v), though produced in quantities exceeding N by 100×, is not reactive for NH3formation at the investigated experimental operating conditions and loss of N2(v) occurs due to vibrational relaxation on the catalyst surface. For oxidation of N2in Ar/N2/O2mixtures, the timescale for N consumption in the gas phase decreases from ~10-3to ~10-4s as the O2concentration increases from 0.1-5%, with gas-phase NO formation increasing as the O2concentration increases. When catalyst is present in the reactor, the timescale for N consumption decreases, and MBMS measurements show that NO formation with Fe or Ag catalyst exceeds NO formation from gas-phase reactions alone at equal residence time, although NO formation is always less than N consumption. These findings and timescales for N consumption in the gas phase and with catalyst present in oxidative and reductive environments will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe direct transformation of methane to liquid fuels and chemicals remains a critical research target due to the availability of natural gas and the abundance of methane in these resources. Methane dehydroaromatization is a promising route for the direct conversion of methane to aromatics (i.e., benzene, toluene, xylenes) under non-oxidative conditions. Among active metals studied for this reaction, Mo/H-ZSM-5 has been shown to be efficient toward C-H activation and formation of aromatic compounds. However, the commercialization of this process remains unfeasible, mainly due to the endothermic nature of this reaction (ΔHRo= + 532 kJ/mol), where equilibrium conversion is limited to 14% at 973 K. In addition, these conditions favor coke formation over the surface of the catalyst, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. An alternative to the thermal conversion of methane to aromatics is the use of non-thermal plasma technologies. Non-thermal plasmas can facilitate chemical conversions of stable molecules (i.e., CH4, CO2and N2) at ambient pressure and temperatures through electron-impact reactions. Therefore, combination of the dehydroaromatization catalyst and non-thermal plasmas could potentially mitigate the limitations presented for this process.In this work, we have addressed questions that remain unanswered regarding the role of the active metal (i.e., Mo) for the conversion of methane to aromatics in a one-pot dielectric barrier discharge reactor. We have specifically investigated the influence of the bulk gas temperature of the plasma-assisted reaction to elucidate the functionality of Mo and determine the contribution to plasma-phase reactions and Mo-catalyzed reactions. Our work shows that conversion of methane to aromatics can take place at temperatures as low as 573 K, where the multifunctionality of Mo/H-ZSM-5 is not required under these conditions. As the bulk gas temperature for the reaction is further increased, we observe additional contributions from Mo-catalyzed pathways toward the production of aromatics under plasma stimulation. This result is supported by the observation of Mo carbide species that are obtained at temperatures of 773 K in the presence of the plasma, which are not observed under thermal conditions using methane as a source. Overall, this presentation will highlight our current understanding of the role of plasma and catalyst for the conversion of methane to aromatics, and the influence of the bulk gas temperature over these complex plasma-catalyst interactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogen (H2) is an energy carrier with high energy content (142 kJ/g) and a non-polluting energy source. Hydrogen's implementation is hindered, however, by delivery and storage issues. Ammonia (NH3) is being studied as a storage medium for H2due to its high H2density, ability to easily condense, storage and distribution. However, thermal NH3cracking to generate H2usually requires the reaction temperatures above 773 K and an earth-rare metal catalyst (i.e., Ru) to achieve complete conversion.One strategy to activate ammonia at mild conditions over earth-abundant metal catalysts is by applying non-thermal plasma since the vibrationally excited species produced in non-thermal plasmas lower the temperature of NH3cracking. However, modelling interfacial plasma-surface interaction is a multi-scale problem and building such simulation for a complex reaction mechanism over a large search space of catalyst materials is computational immense.To solve the above challenge, it is important to identify the key descriptor that impacts the overall rates of ammonia cracking under non-thermal plasma conditions and apply such descriptor to screen the large search space of catalysts. Thus, we first built the microkinetic model for ammonia cracking over various metallic surfaces (e.g., Ni, Co, Ru, Fe). Our theoretical results indicate that plasma lowers the energetics of the first N-H bond cleavage in NH3 and improves the overall rates by creating vibrationally excited state. Then we performed the sensitivity analysis to identify the key descriptor of N2dissociative desorption from surface N*. We then applied this descriptor to scan the catalyst materials and found that earth-abundant Ni-Co alloy showed satisfactory catalytic performance compared to that of earth-rare Ru. AI-predicted catalysts will be further validated by experiments using a dielectric-barrier discharge reactor. The integration of multi-scale modeling, machine learning algorithms and experiments will facilitate materials development in interfacial plasma-surface reaction rather than trial-and-error.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPropylene oxide (PO) is a critical feedstock chemical for the large-scale production of polyurethane plastics and other compounds. While centralized and large-scale PO production has its advantages, due to the high toxicity of PO and the high transportation and long-term storage costs, there is also a strong incentive to produce PO on-site and in time on a smaller scale for applications that do not necessarily require a high volume and concentration. These niche applications include using PO as a fumigant and disinfectant for food,1a sterilizer for medical equipment,2and in forming modified food such as starch and alginate.3Herein, we designed a plasma-liquid interaction catalytic process using only water and propylene (C3H6) as reactants to form PO. Plasma-liquid interactions can activate a wide range of chemical transformations at ambient conditions and form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with relatively high efficiencies.4, 5The H2O2generated in the plasma-liquid interactions serves as an oxidizing agent that epoxidizes the dissolved C3H6over a titanium silicate-1 (TS-1) catalyst dispersed in the water solution. We explored different reactor designs to suppress the generation of deep oxidation products (i.e., CO2) and reach a carbon-based selectivity of more than 98%. Also, the influence of plasma parameters on the activity and selectivity of PO production is investigated. The findings provide us with a method to produce on-demand PO using only C3H6and water, which can be suitable for various specialized applications.ReferencesDanyluk, M. D.; Uesugi, A. R.; Harris, L.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe potential for non-thermal plasma to activate strong chemical bonds has provided alternative routes for chemical transformations at milder reaction conditions. Plasma-activated catalysis combines plasma and catalytic contributions to enhance chemical reactions. The choice of catalytic material is pivotal in harnessing the synergistic relationship observed when stimulated by plasma. However, material design that can effectively harness the plasma-catalyst synergy depends on the fundamental understanding of relevant plasma-activated surface reaction pathways. Moreover, in these plasma-catalytic systems, plasma phase reactions can dominate, which often complicates the analysis and contribution of the catalyst surface reactivity to the overall product yields.This presentation will focus on our recent investigation in elucidating the reactivity of plasma-activated nitrogen species on a metal surface. To do this, we employ sequential exposure of the catalyst surface to the different reactant gases in which the plasma-activated nitrogen is subjected to temperature-programmed reactions with another reactant (hydrogen or oxygen). By so doing, we can evaluate the reactivity of plasma-activated nitrogen under reductive and oxidative conditions. Under hydrogenation conditions, we observe the formation of NH3over different silica-supported metal catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt). Hence, this shows that after plasma activates nitrogen, metal surfaces can perform hydrogenation chemistry to produce NH3. Further, microkinetic modeling calculations show that the temperature of NH3formation scales with the activation barrier for surface hydrogenation. Under oxidative conditions over Pt and Au catalysts, we observed the formation of NO and N2O. Interestingly, we observed that the metal affinity towards oxygen activation is critical in directing product selectivity, with Pt being more selective to NO while Au is more selective to N2O. This further elaborates on the effect of metal surface reactivity under plasma stimulation. Taken together, our study highlights the significance of catalytic contribution and surface reactivity, which is highly relevant for guiding material selection and design principles for plasma-activated processes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe presence of wastewater creates a perfect habitat for the development of a broad range of bacteria and viruses, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella, and Rotavirus. The bacterium Escherichia coli, sometimes known as E. coli, is commonly found in both human and animal digestive systems. When E. coli is identified in wastewater, it may indicate that the water has been polluted with excrement, which may lead to health problems. Due to its extensive dispersion, the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) may be found in wastewater. S. aureus is the causal agent of a broad range of infections, from those that just affect the skin to those that may be deadly, such as pneumonia and septic shock. Salmonella is a pathogen that may be transferred from animals to people via the eating of infected food. Salmonella enterica is the most frequent kind of bacterium that causes illness, although there are many others. It has also been identified in polluted food and water. Salmonella may be found in high numbers in the wastewater of certain kinds of institutions, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities that house a significant number of animals, such as farms and slaughterhouses.Photocatalysis is rapidly becoming one of the most popular technologies for wastewater treatment due to its low cost, environmental friendliness, and adaptability. There are numerous different technologies for cleaning wastewater, but photocatalysis has significant features that set it apart. This wastewater treatment technique is not only cost-effective, but it can also be readily scaled up to handle large volumes. There is no need to use costly or perhaps harmful chemicals. The application of this approach has the potential to clear the environment of microplastics, medications, and other developing types of pollution.Mucilage is a viscous, gel-like material present in many plants, including aloe vera, cactus, and okra. Because of its unique features, such as its ability to lower surface tension and stabilize emulsions, mucilage has been investigated as a possible alternative to synthetic surfactants. Surfactants are substances that may lessen the surface tension between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid, making it easier for them to mix and interact. They are frequently utilized in a broad range of applications, such as cleaning, foaming, and emulsification. The use of mucilage as a surfactant for photocatalysts has the potential to increase photocatalytic reaction efficiency. Photocatalysts are materials that may enhance chemical reactions when exposed to light, and they are commonly employed in wastewater treatment and air purification to degrade contaminants.In this work, we studied the possibility of spray coating photocatalyst onto a substrate with cactus mucilage to improve the chemical structure of the photocatalyst. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) doped Zinc oxide thin films were produced onto glass substrates utilizing a spray coating method at various annealing temperatures and concentrations. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy were used to analyze the new photocatalyst (TEM).

    "abstract": "AbstractThe selective activation of C-H bonds is critical in synthesizing pharmaceuticals, natural products, and fine chemicals. Alcohol oxidation, however, is often carried out under harsh conditions with organometallic complexes as catalysts. Electrochemical routes typically require larger overpotentials to overcome the sluggish kinetics for C-H activation. Mediators such as TEMPO have been successfully employed to reduce these large overpotentials. Unfortunately, these mediators are relatively expensive, unsuitable for large-scale reactions, and show limited modularity. Baran and coworkers further developed N-Ammonium ylide mediators to resolve the modularity issue. However, oxidation with these mediators still requires large positive overpotentials.Herein, we discuss a new electrochemical synthetic method developed by the White group called reductive oxidation, where peroxydisulfate (S2O82–) is reduced and subsequently used to drive alcohol oxidation. Thus, alcohol oxidation occurs due to an electrochemical reduction reaction. First-principles density functional theory calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations are presented that examine the mechanism and provide insights into the mediated oxidation of alcohols. Explicit solvent dynamics of solution-phase mediator species and Marcus Theory capture the kinetics of electron transfers. Electrocatalytic reduction of S2O82–is first mediated by a Ru(NH3)63+/2+mediator. Ru(NH3)62+transfers an electron to S2O82–in a rate-limiting electron transfer step. S2O83–●, with a lifetime of the order of picoseconds, concertedly disproportionate to generate SO42-and the highly oxidizing SO4-●. This dual-mediated strategy reduces the overpotential for the reduction of S2O82–and homogeneously forms SO4-●away from the electrode, mitigating the direct reduction of this species. SO4–●then carries out subsequent hydrogen atom abstractions and proton-coupled-electron transfer steps. This approach thus provides a selective synthetic route for the oxidation of alcohols carried out under mild conditions to aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids with up to 99% conversion yields.",

However, most studies remain focused on the transformation of inorganic species such as CO2, N2, and H2O or biomass conversion. Achieving a Net-Zero chemical industry requires electrification efforts to be expanded to high-volume petrochemical transformations involving the manipulation of C(sp3)−H and C(sp3)−C(sp3) bonds and requires a fundamental understanding of the interfacial processes occurring in transformation organic species at electrode surfaces.Here we investigate room temperature alkane transformations on platinum as a model system using electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS). We show that the potential provides control over the conversion of catalytic alkane intermediates while they are bound to an electrocatalyst surface. The ability to manipulate the chemical identity of intermediates after their adsorption by changing the applied potential represents a significant advancement in controlling catalytic reactions. Exploiting the phenomenon using time dependent potential profiles provides an avenue to both control the product distribution of alkane fragmentation reactions as well as conduct mechanistic investigations into reaction pathways. Using this technique, we investigated the reaction network connecting butane electrooxidation and fragmentation to provide insight to guide alcohol and alkane fuel cell catalyst design. The manipulation of adsorbed species through the applied potential is a widely applicable for reaction control and investigation and thus holds the promise of enabling a broad swath of electrocatalytic transformations.",

Dynamic catalysis is a newly explored field that tackles these limitations by using potential modulation to access higher rates and surpass the static Sabatier maximum. This is achieved by providing elementary steps such as adsorption, reaction, and desorption, with the energetic environment needed to maximize the overall catalytic turnover. Here, we explore the electro-oxidation of formic acid over platinum, an extensively studied chemistry with well-defined mechanisms, to investigate the thermodynamic properties and energetic costs of dynamic systems that need to be considered, along with the challenges that may arise when implementing potentiodynamic methods. The oscillations were applied in square-wave form from 0 V to 0.8 V vs. NHE with equal time spent at each potential (50% duty cycle). Based on kinetic data, it was found that at a frequency of 0.1 Hz, the rate of CO2formation was 8.5 times higher than the static Sabatier maximum condition, which was observed at 0.6 V vs NHE. Correlations were established from fundamental thermodynamic concepts, as well as kinetic and electrochemical measurements, to examine the faradaic (εFE), thermodynamic (εTE), and energy efficiency (εEE) related to potential oscillations. According to the established correlations, it was found that potential oscillations have minimal effects on both the faradaic and energy efficiencies, as shown inFigure 1A. Additionally, fundamental calculations showed that the thermodynamic efficiency increased to 32% compared to the static maximum of 18% (Figure 1B), with the increase being frequency independent..",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical alkene epoxidations offer a promising alternative to existing epoxidation technologies. By applying an anodic potential (>2.0 VRHE) at ambient conditions, H2O acts as the oxygen source for the epoxidation of alkenes. Prior studies on C2+alkene electroepoxidations utilized batch reactors and offer limited product analysis, catalyst characterization, and stability examination. To date, a mechanistic understanding of electroepoxidations remains elusive. Here, we probe the reaction mechanism for 1-hexene (C6H12)electroepoxidation with H2O to 1,2-epoxyhexane (C6H12O) in an aqueous-organic electrolyte by combining kinetic studies varying applied potential, [H2O], and [C6H12] within situRaman spectroscopy to examine the kinetically relevant intermediate.Cyclic voltammetry in a flow cell reveals that C6H12electroepoxidation occurs at potentials greater than 2.0 VRHEand 1.96 VRHEon Au and MnOx, respectively. Current densities at potentials greater than the onset of H2O oxidation decrease by a factor of three with increasing C6H12activities (0.02 <aC6H12< 1.4), indicating that C6H12epoxidation competes with H2O oxidation. Complementary measurements show current densities increase logarithmically as H2O activities rise above 4 and remain constant with further increases above ~30, suggesting the competing reactions both require O-atoms derived from an active surface species. We propose that C6H12epoxidation and H2O oxidation share a pathway to form active oxygen-containing surface species. This species either reacts with C6H12to form C6H12O for epoxidation or proceeds through the H2O oxidation mechanism to form O2. Bulk electrolysis demonstrates that soluble MnO4-forms from MnOxat oxidizing potentials, and these complexes may react with C6H12in the fluid-phase to form C6H12O in stoichiometric processes. On both Au and MnOx, FE values for epoxidations increase as potentials decrease. Scanning electrochemical measurements quantify the standard heterogeneous rate constant and charge transfer coefficient. Insights from this study can be used to optimize selectivity (electron, carbon) and reaction conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCurrent propylene oxide production relies on highly energy-intensive and hazardous oxidants, such as chlorine and peroxides. While direct oxidation of propylene using molecular oxygen has been explored as an alternative solution, achieving high selectivity for propylene oxide is challenging due to the allylic hydrogen stripping in propylene and consequent further oxidation. In this regard, a selective direct propylene epoxidation pathway using water as a cleaner and easily accessible oxygen source would present a compelling alternative to the current epoxidation methods. In this work, we developed an oxidized palladium-platinum alloy catalyst, which enables efficient oxygen-atom transfer from water to propylene without using mediators. This catalyst reaches a Faradaic efficiency of 66±5% toward propylene epoxidation at 50 mA/cm2at ambient temperature and pressure, outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts for direct epoxidation. Embedding platinum into the palladium oxide crystal structure stabilized oxidized platinum species, resulting in improved catalyst performance. The reaction mechanism was investigated using a multi-faceted approach including kinetic rate measurements, probe substrate analysis, and substrate-based descriptor assessment. The reaction kinetics suggest that epoxidation on this catalyst proceeds through the electrophilic attack by metal-bound peroxo intermediates. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for selective electrochemical oxygen-atom transfer from water, without mediators, for diverse oxygenation reactions.",

Various transition metals like Silver, copper, cobalt, and nickel are explored as potential catalysts as they are previously shown to facilitate the formation of the C-N bond which goes through nitrate to ammonia to imines. Silver has been identified as the most promising catalyst because it had the best kinetics and was the most active catalyst as compared to other transition metals.2The system was optimized by varying electrolyte constitutions, counter cations, and supporting electrolyte anions to obtain better faradaic efficiency, current densities, and selectivity.

    "abstract": "AbstractSimulating charge transfer reactions at electrochemical interfaces poses a unique set of challenges. It is essential to capture (1) the motion of charges within the metal electrode, electrolyte solution and between the two phases, (2) how this changes as an electric potential is applied to the electrodes and the total number of electrons in the system fluctuates, and (3) the specific and dynamically changing chemical bonding and adsorption interactions within the electrolyte and between the electrolyte and electrode as chemical reactions are occurring. Moreover, describing reactions requires us to sample a large ensemble of rare reactive events requiring extremely efficient computational methods. In this talk, we will describe how High Dimensional Neural Network Potential Energy models can be combined with Classical Constant Electric potential methods used to treat charged conductors to simultaneously address these challenges and allow us to simulate heterogeneous electrochemical reactions at working electrodes with near ab initio accuracy at costs near classical molecular dynamics. This new simulation technique allows us to apply powerful tools from statistical mechanical rate theories to rigorously study electrochemical reactions at atomic resolution.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDry reforming of methane (DRM) has gained significant interest for its ability to convert two major greenhouse gases, CH4and CO2, into syngas [1]. Nickel-based catalysts are highly active for DRM, but they are highly susceptible to sintering and carbon deposition [2]. Consequently, extensive research has been directed towards enhancing their stability against sintering and preventing the formation of carbonaceous deposits. As a support, CeO2is known to enhance the nickel dispersion, which in turn improves the resistance of catalyst against sintering and coke formation. We herein successfully developed Ni/CeO2catalysts with different Ni local coordination environments (Ni/CeO2and Ni/CeO2_OH) by using two different CeO2supports. The experimental results showed that the Ni/CeO2_OH catalyst exhibited considerably higher activity and stability in the DRM reaction comparing to Ni/CeO2(Figure 1a). CH4conversion declined 26% on Ni/CeO2_OH after 12 hrs on-stream, while reduced up to 41% on Ni/CeO2(Figure 1b). It was found that more coke species were present on spent Ni/CeO2_OH than on spent Ni/CeO2despite the better activity and stability achieved on the former catalyst, evidencing that the catalytic deactivation was dominated by the sintering of Ni species rather than the coke deposition. This was confirmed by the results of EDS mapping of spent catalysts after 12 hrs of DRM (Figure 1c, 1d). It was observed that 5Ni/CeO2_OH catalyst has a much smaller crystalline size of CeO2,and larger surface area comparing to 5Ni/CeO2, suggesting that the strong interaction between Ni and CeO2within Ni/CeO2_OH catalyst significantly suppressed the sintering of Ni during DRM reaction.References[1] R.Y.

    "abstract": "AbstractMaximizing the metal functionality in the acidic zeolite is critical to the design of efficient bi-functional catalytic materials with minimized noble metal loading for cost-efficient chemical syntheses. To develop an efficient catalyst for light alkanes dehydroaromatization (DHA), Pt is incorporated into the acidic HZSM-5 zeolite, leading to the synergized metal/acid functionalities. However, the Pt species in HZSM-5 are likely to be located at the Brønsted acid sites, forming [Ptm-Hn]n+adduct with positive Pt charges. However, increased electron deficiency is not desired for DHA because it stabilizes the platinum-ethylene complex, leading to the formation of heavier oligomers and accelerating catalyst deactivation. According to our recent studies, the lifespan (stability) of Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst during ethane DHA depends highly on the loading of Pt. While the lifespan of the 0.05wt% Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst is about 15 h, the 0.01wt% Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst was completely deactivated within only 4 h, which was further decreased to 1 h when decreasing the Pt loading to 0.005 wt%.We show that the activity and stability of 0.005-0.01 wt% (50-100 ppm) Pt/HZSM-5 during ethane DHA can be significantly improved by tuning the coordination structure of the Pt species from [Ptm-Hn]n+adduct to [Pt1-Znn]δ+hybrid cluster. The specific activity of BTX is up to 8.2 mol/gPt/min (or 1592 min-1) over the 10 ppm Pt-Zn2/HZSM-5 catalyst. The deactivation constant for the [Pt1-Znn]δ+cluster is decreased by a factor of 120 in contrast to that of the [Ptm-Hn]n+counterpart. With the concept of tuning the Pt metal functionality by coordinating isolated Pt to metal/metal oxo clusters, we show that it remains high potential to maximize the metal functionality of Pt (or other PGMs) – lowering Pt loading to ppm level – in the acidic zeolites for efficient DHA of the stable light alkanes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOligomerization of light alkenes to liquid fuels and value-added products is an important reaction to upgrade domestic shale gas and biomass-based feedstocks. To overcome the inherent limitations of homogeneous catalysts based on nickel complexes, numerous efforts have been reported to tailor Ni(II)-based solid catalysts for this reaction, particularly with MOFs and zeolites. Nevertheless, MOFs suffer from lower thermal resistance and often require the use of toxic co-catalysts. Alternatively, zeolites deactivate rapidly and residual Brønsted acidity promotes cracking and skeletal isomerization, leading to unselective product mixtures.To overcome these challenges, we previously reported the use of lacunary Wells-Dawson polyoxometalates as platforms to isolate single Ni2+sites, which were supported on Brønsted-acid-free mesoporous SBA-15. This material was demonstrated to be versatile, regenerable, and unaffected by the presence of feed contaminants, showing high selectivity towards linear products both with ethylene and propylene feeds. Although the oligomerization of ethylene and propylene require different operating conditions, we have investigated the effect of co-feeding the two reactants together. Furthermore, we explored the influence of several structural and chemical modifications of the polyoxometalates on the nickel active sites, providing insights in the design of polyoxometalates-based catalysts with tailored properties. Various strategies to increase the site density have also been explored, in order to overcome the limitations of dispersing the bulky structure of polyoxometalates on the supports. Lastly, we discuss our efforts incorporating Ni active sites in Anderson-Evans polyoxometalates through a one-pot synthesis, that significantly simplifies the production of the catalyst. Further, the smaller dimensions of this structure allows better catalyst dispersions and potentially higher loadings. Overall, this work highlights the synthetic versatility of POMs for light olefin oligomerization and points to new opportunities for catalyst discovery.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMethane dehydroaromatization (MDA) is a promising route of direct methane transformation to aromatics under non-oxidative conditions. For MDA process, the benchmark catalyst is Mo/H-ZSM-5 as it shows high aromatic selectivity and near equilibrium conversion (~12% yield at 700 ⁰C); however, its outstanding performance rapidly declines over time due to the formation of carbonaceous species. According to literature, Brønsted acid sites and MoOxspecies on its external surface are known to cause an unselective methane conversion. Although the coke formed during MDA could be removed by combustion, Mo/H-ZSM-5 does not recover its initial catalytic activity due to zeolite dealumination. Therefore, engineering Mo/H-ZSM-5 properties to reduce undesired coke formation is needed.In this work, to slow down the process of coke formation, we passivated the Mo/H-ZSM-5 external surface with SiO2and Al2O3overcoats utilizing atomic layer deposition (ALD). By overcoating SiO2on Mo/H-ZSM-5, C6H6yield was enhanced without a change in the deactivation rate constant rate (kd). For overcoating Al2O3on Mo/H-ZSM-5, C6H6yield was found to be suppressed and deactivating faster than Mo/H-ZSM-5 (see attached figure). Furthermore, incorporation of SiO2and Al2O3overcoats did not impact the prevalent reaction pathway.Additionally, the overcoating effect was tested under isothermal oxidative regeneration. The C6H6yield declined after each regeneration cycle with minimal difference between all catalyst after first cycle. For all catalysts, overcoats deposition on external surface area was verified by TEM and non-modifications of textural properties. Moreover, MoOxredispersion due to overcoats was corroborated by UV-Vis, H2-TPR andIn situUV-Raman which supported catalytic results. Furthermore,27Al-MAS NMR of fresh and spent catalysts were contrasted and implied that zeolite-dealumination after regeneration occurred independently of the overcoats. Overall, this targeted modification on Mo/H-ZSM-5's external surface area showed an improvement MDA’s performance which could be extrapolated to other catalytic transformations.",

    "abstract": "AbstractExtending catalyst lifetimes can greatly reduce downtime and cost of industrial processes. In this work, we focus on ferrierite deactivation during the isomerization of 1-butene to iso-butene. Iso-butene is a valuable intermediate to produce rubbers, solvents, and fuel additives. During this isomerization, the catalyst inevitably experiences carbon deposition (“coking”) which in this case is simultaneously beneficial and detrimental. While carbonaceous deposits contribute to catalytic activity for this reaction, they gradually deactivate the catalyst by blocking reactive sites. While consensus exists about the mechanism during reaction startup, the reaction mechanism at the peak catalyst performance is still contested.Here, we demonstrate the presence of radical species on carbon deposits during 1-butene isomerization. The radical concentration increased as a function of reaction time, which was confirmed through EPR analysis. The addition of the radical scavenger 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine deactivated the catalyst (Figure 1) and accelerated coke formation. This finding suggest that unpaired electrons influence the catalyst activity.Finally, we aim to locate the active sites. Nitrogen physisorption results indicate that the micropore volume of ferrierite rapidly decreases upon coking, while butene physisorption suggests that the micropores are inaccessible to small hydrocarbons at any time. Thus, the active sites must be located either on the surface of ferrierite or at the pore mouths. This observation is consistent with our hypothesis that coke-based radicals anchored in the pore mouths are the active catalytic species of butene isomerization. The knowledge gained here is likely applicable to other zeolite catalyzed hydrocarbon conversion reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPartial oxidation of methane (POM) is an exothermic alternative pathway to produce synthesis gas (syngas), a mixture of CO and H2, compared to the endothermic steam reforming of methane. Noble metals supported on various metal oxides, such as TiO2, and Al2O3, are active and stable catalysts in the methane partial oxidation reaction, and IrO2/TiO2is a particularly interesting combination with high selectivity to syngas. Despite the potential for IrO2/TiO2in the POM reaction, few articles report on the differences in metal-support interactions between iridium and three main crystal phases of TiO2, namely rutile, anatase, and brookite phase. To determine how the crystal phase of TiO2influences the activity and selectivity in the POM reaction, we synthesized IrO2/TiO2catalysts with four different TiO2supports. Iridium was deposited onto the TiO2supports using the urea deposition-precipitation method, and calcination in air at 350 °C resulted in the IrO2/TiO2catalyst. The catalytic performance of the IrO2/TiO2in the methane partial oxidation reaction was then evaluated as a function of pretreatment conditions. Reduction at 200 °C is expected to reduce only the IrO2to metallic Ir, while reduction at 500 °C can also reduce some of the TiO2, dependent on the crystal structure of the TiO2. Reducing condition can alter the Ir-TiO2interactions, which in turn can influence the catalytic properties of IrO2under the reaction conditions. The IrO2on rutile TiO2nanoparticles after 500 °C reduction (Figure 1(a)), exhibits the best CH4conversion (88.8%) as well as 100% CO selectivity at 650 °C, while the worst performing catalyst is supported on anatase TiO2(Figure 1 (b)).",

    "abstract": "AbstractSolvents play a significant role in mediating catalysis, especially in confined environments (e.g., microporous zeolites), through interactions with reactive species nearby active sites. However, kinetics within confined structures often reflects the convoluted effects of solvents, including dispersive interactions (“solvation”) and thermodynamic nonideality depending on micropore topology, solvent organization, and the physical properties of reactive species. Here, we demonstrate that an intentional condensation of gaseous acetonitrile (CH3CN) leads to changes in the vapor-phase alkene epoxidation kinetics, and changes in rate, selectivity, and activation barrier respond differently to the condensed CH3CN density and the size of substrates (i.e., varying chain length from propylene to 1-decene; CnH2n, 3 ≤ n ≤ 10).We synthesized Ti-BEA zeolites with varying intrapore silanol ((SiOH)x) densities and controlled CH3CN partial pressures to introduce different densities of intrapore CH3CN, varying from 0.4 to 10 molecule∙(unit cell)-1. Turnover rates of longer-chain alkenes (C6-C10) epoxidation increase systematically by 3-fold with CH3CN density. However, rates for short-chain alkenes (C3-C4) weakly depend on CH3CN density. Apparent activation enthalpies and entropies for epoxidations (at a fixed CH3CN density) decrease with carbon numbers from C3to C6, then increase from C6to C10, and these changes range between 30 kJ∙mol-1and 80 J∙mol-1∙K-1, respectively. These results infer that the stabilization by condensing CH3CN onto the reactive species depends on the substrate sizes. Solvation by CH3CN surrounding reactive species leads to an enthalpic stabilization of short-chain alkene substrates, while more significant reorganization of CH3CN to accommodate bulkier transition states results in entropic benefits to the epoxidation kinetics. Dynamic vapor sorption andin situinfrared spectroscopy reveal that the CH3CN reorganization depends systematically on the chain length and intrapore CH3CN densities. Collectively, these results demonstrate the role of solvents within confined structures that strongly depends on the size of reactants and the proximity to active sites.",

Quantitative methods for assessing site (non)uniformity, as opposed to distributions of kinetic properties that are instead oftentimes reported merely as ensemble averages, have clearly been lacking; using CO oxidation as a probe reaction, this talk will show how the application of MIL-100(Fe) - a metal-organic framework material (MOF) endowed with mixed-valent trinuclear metal nodes [M2+(M3+)2O] [1] (Figure 1A) - exhibits a degree of uniformity sufficient to help unravel second sphere coordination effects in which ligand binding external to the primary coordination sphere of a metal atom alters reactivity even in the absence of direct binding interactions with the active site. A combination of kinetic, isotopic, titrative, and in-situ spectroscopic data indicate that the coordination environment of homogeneous μ3-oxo complexes can be replicated over theentiretyof the active site pool of MIL-100(Fe), and thatindirectsecond sphere effects help alter free energies of kinetically relevant transition states.Turnover rates and apparent activation energies were consistently found to decrease and increase, respectively, with the average moles of water adsorbed per node into the secondary coordination sphere of open-metal sites (Figure 1B). Ensemble-average rate data can be rigorously deconvoluted into individual rate contributions from nodes with three distinct degrees of hydration (Figure 1C), with reduced rates on partially water-covered beds changing non-linearly versus the fraction of sites titrated, consistent with disproportionate contributions (toward measured rates) of sites binding NO more strongly.

    "abstract": "AbstractMethane dehydroaromatization (MDA), a non-oxidative direct process for producing benzene and other aromatics from methane, has attracted great attention in recent decades. Mo-oxide-impregnated H-ZSM-5, the most widely studied catalyst for MDA, has demonstrated effective catalytic properties toward benzene formation. Nonetheless, rapid catalyst deactivation is a great challenge for MDA commercialization. Among many unsettled questions underlying MDA, understanding the speciation of the Mo-oxide catalyst precursors that reduce into the catalytically active oxycarbide and carbide species is of great importance.Through previous work, we have demonstrated that Mo-oxide precursors exist in several stoichiometries including MoO2OH+, MoO22+, and Mo2O52+, and the distribution may be influenced by catalyst synthesis technique (incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) or physical mixing (PM)), metal loading, and the zeolite acidity. Each unique motif anchors differently at the Brønsted acidic sites (BAS), and the anchoring temperature is dependent on the method of impregnating the metal oxide into the zeolite. In complement to our endeavors, we investigated the distributions of each Mo-oxide species as a function of zeolite acidity and metal loading using thousands of models of Mo/H-ZSM-5 with varying acidity and Mo loading using Monte Carlo methods. We have compared the results of our statistical models with water desorption quantification from temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments. The mechanism of anchoring Mo-oxides at the BAS and the transformation of anchored Mo-oxo species (MoO2OH+) to other types of Mo-oxide species, MoO22+and Mo2O52+, has also been simulated using climbing image nudged elastic band methods. We have further investigated anchoring of Mo-oxides (MoO22+and Mo2O52+) at Al site pairs at various separations using DFT, identifying numerous anchoring motifs not conventionally studied, and considered these models in MC simulations. Through this work, we have built an understanding at the atomistic level that facilitates interpretation of our experimental characterizations of these systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractZeolite Sn-Beta is an intriguing catalyst for numerous reactions involved in biomass upgrading and fine chemical production. Interestingly, Sn-Beta is proposed to have three distinct catalytic sites: defect-open, hydrolyzed-open, and closed sites. The quantification of different sites is crucial for establishing structure-reactivity relationships for Sn-Beta, as previous investigations suggest a correlation between specific types of sites and improved activity for certain reactions. To quantify and determine the catalytic contributions of different sites, “poisoning experiments” may be performed wherein a Lewis base is added to deactivate a certain fraction of Sn sites before catalytic testing. Though poisoning experiments are becoming more widespread, several challenges remain in that there is limited investigation of experimental parameters and inadequate evidence to support the assignment of catalytic contributions to specific sites. This work successfully addresses these challenges using NMR to complement poisoning experiment data.The effect of poison (triethylamine, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, or trimethylphosphine oxide) and solvent (hexane or dichloromethane) on poisoning experiment results is investigated. The poison affects resulting site distributions, and the solvent impacts poisoning mechanism (random vs. preferential). Pyridine in hexane is identified as an ideal poison/solvent combination for epoxide ring opening (ERO) using Sn-Beta.15N NMR analyses suggest that pyridine (dosed in hexane) poisons sites in the following order: (1) all defect-open and a fraction of closed Sn sites, (2) hydroxyl groups coordinated to Sn at defect-open and hydrolyzed-open sites, and (3) remaining closed Sn sites. Additionally, results indicate that defect-open Sn sites have the highest activity, followed unexpectedly by hydroxyl groups then closed Sn sites. Ongoing work will resolve the role of hydroxyl groups in ERO. Overall, this work highlights poisoning experiments as a unique and insightful site quantification technique when combined harmoniously with NMR. Furthermore, results will help to establish valuable synthesis-structure-activity relationships for Sn-Beta materials.",

Metal perchloro-, perfluoro-, and perhydrogenated phthalocyanines (MCl16PC, MF16PC, and MPC; M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), were encapsulated into FAU via hydrothermal synthesis (MPC@FAU). MPC@FAU catalysts were characterized usingin situdiffuse reflectance UV-Visible and X-ray absorption spectroscopies, andex situelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. After confirming the zeolites were crystalline and the MPC complexes were intact, MPC@FAU catalysts were tested for aerobic CO oxidation at 298 K. Initial site time yields (STYs, per mol of metal) for MPC@FAU were an order of magnitude greater than the analogous metal-ion-exchanged zeolites (by ~50×, 4 kPa CO, 30 kPa O2, balance He). Initial STYs for CO oxidation are also higher (by 2-10×) for MPC@FAU samples than the corresponding samples with the same MPC deposited on the external surface of FAU, suggesting increased reactivity due to encapsulation within FAU. Binding energies for CO and O2calculated with density functional theory evince correlations between the initial STY and the difference between the binding energy for CO and O2,with optimalMPC@FAUcatalysts (Co, Zn) binding CO and O2with similar strengths. This activity decreases with time on stream for all MPC-containing catalysts tested, though not due to occlusion of pores with adsorbed CO, O2, CO2, or water; this unexpected deactivation is a topic of ongoing research. The reactivities of MPC@FAU catalysts for gas-phase CO oxidation at ambient temperature, along with ongoing studies of other societally relevant chemistries, indicate that MPC@FAU catalysts can serve as model catalytic materials for gas-phase reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous catalysts active in diverse chemical transformations, including hydrocarbon oxidation by benign oxidants (e.g., hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and air).1,2Here, Fe-based carboxylate MIL-100(Fe), MIL-101(Fe), and NH2-MIL-101(Fe) were synthesized3-5to decouple the effects of framework pore size, Fe oxidation state, and coordination environment on reactivity, selectivity, and material stability for a probe aryl (styrene) oxidation utilizing H2O2. Mesoporous MIL-101 and MIL-100 have similar MTN zeotype framework structures, but MIL-100 has smaller pore-limiting diameters (0.86 nm, 0.55 nm) in contrast with those for MIL-101 (1.6 nm, 1.2 nm). Here, the kinetic diameter of styrene is 0.60 nm, indicating that styrene (and oxygenate products) may diffuse through all MIL-101 cages, but only through the larger MIL-100 cage. MIL-101(Fe) demonstrates higher lumped first-order rate constants (normalized by moles of Fe) for styrene oxidation compared to MIL-100(Fe) at 323 K. This disparity in reactivity is a result of less accessible sites in MIL-100 compared to MIL-101 but also depends on coordination environment, acidic/basic site densities, Fe valency distributions, and surface coverages by DMF-derivedspecies originating from different synthetic procedures that all govern oxygenate selectivities and material stability. MIL-101(Fe) is also more reactive than NH2-functionalized MIL-101(Fe) despite identical pore sizes. Inductive effects of the amine group decrease metal site and reactive intermediate electrophilicities and, thus, rates. Notably, NH2-MIL-101(Fe) demonstrates fractional benzaldehyde selectivity near unity compared to ≤0.59 ±0.03 for MIL-101(Fe), which is likely rooted in disparate H2O2-derived reactive intermediate distributions imposed by first and second coordination effects. Finally, deactivation mechanisms are probed for all three frameworks, but the degree of metal leaching, Fe valency changes, and CxHyOzNmsurface coverages differ in their relative contributions to catalyst inefficiencies. Overall, this work provides fundamental insight into structure-function relationships for transition-metal MOF oxidation catalysts.References[1] https://doi.org/10.1021/cr9003924[2] https://doi.org/10.1039/C1CY00068C[3] https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01776[4] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2012.11.003[5] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.122",

    "abstract": "AbstractPartial methane oxidation (PMO) to methanol can be carried out both step-wise and continuously over Cu-Chabazite (Cu-CHA) catalysts. A wide variety of Cu species have been proposed as possible PMO active sites. Experimental observations show that methanol production in step-wise processes is always less than the stoichiometry suggested by the Cu loading, suggesting the presence of multiple Cu exchange sites, only some of which are active for PMO. To aid in rationalizing these observations, we compute the free energies of formation of the most commonly suggested Cu dimers (O-bridged, O2-bridged, OH-bridged, and (OH)2-bridged) and monomers at different locations in CHA, relative to isolated Cu species, using supercell density functional theory. We find that formation energies are a strong function of both Al anchoring sites and activation conditions, and that at some sites, free energy differences between different Cu species are small, which may account for apparent differences in observed PMO activity. We use a titration procedure to populate exchange sites for a given distribution of Al.We find a large fraction of 8MR-3NN sites that have a preference to condense O-bridged Cu dimers. However, a non-negligible fraction of other PMO-active Cu species at other locations are also expected to be present, many of which may contribute to methane activation. These results are consistent with prior calculations and explain the range of Cu active sites and condensation sites reported in the literature. These results highlight how the active sites are influenced by the CHA topology, and subsequently impact on the catalytic activity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn the realm of heterogeneous catalysis, the stability, and shapes of active metal catalyst sites during reactions are critical for catalytic activity. This study aims to enhance our understanding of catalytic systems by building on previous coordination-based approaches [1] that predicted general configurational energies of metal nanostructures. However, the generalized scheme does not explicitly define partial coordination to neighboring atoms, making it challenging to understand the stability of adatoms during non-equilibrium states of diffusion or migration. Therefore, we use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate activation energies for atomic diffusions/migrations over various FCC surfaces to evaluate the stability of metal atoms. From these results, we extract coordination-based parameters to fit to the energies of atoms at non-equilibrium distances. This extended model is used to gain a better understanding of surface restructuring and sintering in heterogeneous catalytic contexts, such as copper catalysts during electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction.Moreover, the optimization of catalytic activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis relies on various surface properties, particularly surface energies, and the distribution of site morphologies. Therefore, we also evaluate surface energies and predict the relative stabilities of various catalytic surfaces using the mentioned coordination schemes. We use periodic slabs and various metal nanoparticle (MNP) shapes to determine surface energies and extended this approach to multimetallic surfaces (alloys) to describe segregation behaviors in multimetallic alloys (MMAs) to predict the relative surface concentrations of the various constituent metals.Overall, this physics-based approach allows for the effective screening of thermodynamic stabilities of alloy MNPs by integrating coordination schemes with structural and site information. The resulting models can be applied to calculate the energetics of any nanoparticle morphology and chemical composition, thus significantly accelerating the design of durable nanoalloys, potentially extending to high entropy alloys.1.

    "abstract": "AbstractFor improved design of platinum-based catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation (EDH), it is important to accurately identify the active site(s). Computational investigations using DFT methods are often inaccurate largely due to errors from the choice of functional and approximations used to compute entropy. Both errors significantly affect the Gibbs free energy (G), which affects the elementary rate constants. This study uses Bayesian modeling of microkinetic models (MKM) to correct Gibbs free energies and identify the active sites for the EDH between three Pt surface sites, i.e., Pt(100), Pt(111), and Pt(211). For each species, a normal distribution of SCF energies (E) was created from covariance matrix of 2000 BEEF ensemble energies and a chemical potential (Δµ) with upper and lower bounds of harmonic oscillator and free translator, respectively, was created. Here, G = E + Δµ. By sampling the E and Δµ space, MKM results were calibrated to five experimental studies at different reaction conditions and with varying numbers of reported observations, turnover frequency etc. We observed that the first dehydrogenation to CH3CH2is rate controlling for ethylene production. On Pt(100) and Pt(111), two competitive second dehydrogenation steps to either CH2CH2or CH3CH decide if ethylene is produced or hydrogenolysis occurs. Methane production is crippled on Pt(100) and Pt(111) due to re-hydrogenation of dehydrogenated C2 species from CH3CH, to CH2CH2. Ethylene is produced on all three facets, while acetylene and methane are largely produced on the Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces, respectively. It was observed that Pt(100), Pt(111), and Pt(211) surfaces are all active for EDH reaction and no evidence was found to support one surface site as the active site over the others. A CSTR Pt particle model was used to further investigate the effect of facet interaction on the EDH reaction.",

The resulting model consists of a system of ordinary differential equations. Adsorbate–adsorbate interactions, surface diffusion, adsorption, desorption, and catalytic reaction processes are included. Assuming that the adspecies ordering/arrangement is accurately described by the SRO parameters, we employ the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) method to extract the relevant local environment probability distributions and pass them to the MKM. The reaction kinetics is faithfully captured as accurately as the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method but with a computational time requirement of few seconds on a standard desktop computer. KMC, on the other hand, can require several days for the examples discussed.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe ability to connect catalytic activity to materials properties has played a pivotal role in the rational design of heterogeneous catalysis. Real catalytic nanoparticles, especially compositionally flexible bimetallic alloys, are complex nanostructures spanning diverse structures and compositions, and exposing a distribution of active sites. To bridge the gap between the structural complexity of nanocatalysts under operation and idealized crystal plane models, various structure-activity relationships have emerged for bimetallic surface facets and nanoparticles. Using features of active sites as inputs, both physics-based and data-driven relationships can evaluate catalytic descriptors with an accuracy of 0.1 to 0.2 eV compared to DFT. It is still a challenge, however, to translate these descriptors into active site-resolved reaction kinetics across the distribution of active sites ubiquitous on bimetallic nanoparticles. Herein, we present a novel physics-based method for predicting the activity of catalytic sites on-the-fly with atomic resolution and near DFT accuracy. Using a series of linear scaling relationships, we show that the local stability (BEM) of an active site can be used as a direct descriptor of catalytic activity. Our approach renders site-specific Sabatier-type volcano plots that offer a powerful tool to assess nanostructural as well as alloying effects in catalysis. This paves the way towards atomic-level design of heterogeneous catalysts for thermal and electrochemical applications. In this work, we showcase our approach on the design of optimal active Pt-based alloy sites for NO decomposition–an important reaction process for, e.g., the purification of vehicle exhaust gas. Using the new approach with site stability as unifying descriptor for activity and durability, it is possible to prescribe specific sizes, morphologies, and compositions of optimal catalytic nanoparticles, guiding towards designing bimetallic catalysts with optimal turnovers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMetal carbide catalysts evolve into oxy-carbide phases during the hydrodeoxygenation of biomass, dry reforming of methane, and ethanol dehydration. Prior studies indicate that oxy-carbide formation is dictated by the chemical potentials of the reductant (e.g., CH4) and oxidizing gases (e.g., CO2). The atomic structure of such oxy-carbide phases has however not yet been determined. We present a graph-based approach that determines the equilibrium coverage of oxy-carbide surfaces as a function of the chemical potential of the environment (CH4:CO2ratio) on (100), (111), and (110) surfaces of early transition metal carbides (VC and TiC). Co-adsorbate interactions between oxygen atoms on the surface are partitioned as pair-wise interactions. The pair-wise interactions are in turn, determined using a distance-dependent quadratic function, whose form is inspired by generalized additive models in machine learning. The functions are constructed based of three observations: (a) co-adsorbate interactions rapidly decay with distance, (b) co-adsorbate interactions are confined to within three nearest neighbours of the active site, and (c) co-adsorbate interactions have weak structure sensitivity. The quadratic functions are trained on density functional theory calculations of O* adsorbed across top, bridge, and hollow sites having coverages ranging from 1/8 to 1 monolayer. The functions yield surface energies under reaction conditions with errors of 4 meV/Å2. These errors are comparable with more sophisticated yet less interpretable neural networks. Upon training the model, we then determine surface energies of 4000+ crystal planes on low index surfaces of TiC, essentially on-the-fly. We down select the most stable surfaces under a given reaction environment and validate their energies with explicit DFT calculations. We employ this tool to determine the most stable (100), (111), and (110) surfaces of VC, as the CH4:CO2ratio is varied. These surface energies are inputted into Wulff constructions, thus revealing how the formation of oxy-carbides alters the carbide morphology.",

However, it takessignificant effort to screen many surfaces for their stability, as this requires intensive quantumchemical calculations. To more efficiently estimate stability, we provide a general and data-efficientmachine learning (ML) approach to accurately and efficiently predict the surface energies of metalalloy surfaces. Our ML approach introduces an element-centered fingerprint (ECFP) which wasused as a vector representation for fitting models for predicting surface formation energies. TheECFP is significantly more accurate than several existing feature sets when applied to dilute alloysurfaces and is competitive with existing feature sets when applied to bulk alloy surfaces orgas-phase molecules. Models using the ECFP as input can be quite general, as we created modelswith good accuracy over a broad set of bimetallic surfaces including most d-block metals, evenwith relatively small datasets. For example, using the ECFP, we developed a kernel ridge regressionML model which is able to predict the surface energies of alloys of diverse metal combinations witha mean absolute error of 0.017 eV atom−1. Combining this model with an existing model forpredicting adsorption energies, we estimated segregation trends of 596 single-atom alloys(SAAs) with and without CO adsorbed on these surfaces. As a simple test of the approach, weidentify specific cases where CO does not induce segregation in these SAAs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMotivationAmmonia is an essential compound to modern day fertilizer production and chemical manufacturing. Global ammonia demand exceeds 150 million tons a year (market value 70 billion USD), with over 96% fulfilled by the Haber Bosch (HB) process. However, HB production plants are energy-intensive (1-2% annual global energy consumption), carbon-intensive (1.2-1.4% annual anthropogenic CO2emissions), and concentrated in developed countries, leading to inequitable pricing and distribution.1–5Electrifying ammonia production with renewable energy can help offset the energy and carbon-intensive HB process in a distributed fashion, where modular process units powered by renewable electricity leverage feedstocks to deliver ammonia at the source.Wastewaters are an underutilized feedstock for electrified ammonia production. Large amounts of reactive nitrogen, such as HB ammonia, accumulate in the biosphere because 80% of wastewater globally is discharged without treatment.6Recovering nitrogen (N) from wastewater can simultaneously fulfill the roles of traditional removal technologies such as nitrification-denitrification and of fertilizer production processes such as HB. Two forms of reactive nitrogen dominate aqueous nitrogen emissions: ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). Wastewater ammonium can be recovered through processes that selectively separate it from other wastewater constituents. Meanwhile, wastewater nitrate can be recovered as ammonia through a selective electrocatalytic reduction reaction followed by a selective separation process. Ammonia recovery from ammonium- and nitrate-rich wastewaters therefore creates opportunities to co-locate selective reactions with selective separations. In this talk, we describe Electrodialysis and Nitrate Reduction (EDNR), a novel electrochemical reactive separation process that efficiently couples water treatment and ammonia production from wastewaters.MethodsThe EDNR reactor consists of three chambers and operates in two stages (Figure 1a). Wastewater influent enters the middle chamber while ammonia is electrochemically recovered in the left and right chambers. In Stage 1 (electrodialysis), influent and migrate to the left and right chambers, respectively, due to an applied potential. During this stage, hydrogen evolution in the right chamber creates an alkaline environment (pH ~ 12). As a result, influent ammonium deprotonates to yield ammonia (pKa ~ 9.25): NH4+<--> NH3+ H+. In Stage 2 (nitrate reduction), ammonia is selectively produced from the electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) in the left chamber: NO3-+ 8e-+ 9H+--> NH3+ 3H2O. Cycling between the two stages generates concentrated ammonia solutions in the right and left chambers. EDNR leverages electrochemical swings to facilitate engineering of the reaction environment in each chamber such that (1) process control is independent of the influent wastewater and (2) a broad portfolio of products can be recovered. For example, phosphorus (P) and/or potassium (K)-containing electrolytes can be used in the left and right chambers to allow production of different fertilizer blends by tuning the N-P-K content (the three macronutrients needed for plant growth).Based on process and product needs, several materials were employed for specific purposes EDNR experiments. In the left chamber, Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5mesh was used for electrodialysis (Stage 1). Meanwhile, Ti foil was used as the NO3RR electrode (Stage 2). Our group has previously characterized the near-surface structure of Ti foil under NO3RR conditions and identified an optimal NH3Faradaic efficiency at−0.8 VRHE.7Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5mesh was used in the middle chamber as a counter electrode for NO3RR. Lastly, Pt foil was used in the right chamber for electrodialysis. An anion exchange membrane separates the left and middle chambers, and a cation exchange membrane separates the middle and right chambers. Simulated wastewater influent (1.6 mM KNO3+ 13.9 mM (NH4)2SO4) and real wastewater (reverse osmosis brine) were used. Electrolytes in each chamber were recirculated in batch.Aqueous speciation was quantified with cation chromatography, anion chromatography, and flow injection analysis (to measure total ammonia nitrogen: sum of aqueous ammonium and aqueous ammonia; indophenol method).ResultsDuring Stage 1 (electrodialysis), we demonstrate effective pH control in the left and right chambers (Figure 1b). The left chamber acidifies to a pH slightly above 1.5, which has been identified as optimal for NO3RR on Ti.8The right chamber basifies to pH ~ 12, facilitating deprotonation of to yield ammonia. After three cycles of EDNR, >95% of influent is recovered as ammonia in the right chamber (Figure 1c). Meanwhile, ~100% of influent is electrochemically reduced to ammonia in the left chamber (Figure 1d). We found three factors that enabled full nitrate conversion to ammonia: (1) the choice of weakly adsorbing perchlorate in the supporting salt; (2) the use of a high concentration of sodium in the supporting salt; and (3) pulsed electrolysis to periodically refresh the interfacial electrolyte. Parametric analyses of additional operating parameters further optimize the energy efficiency, nitrate conversion, and ammonia recovery rate of EDNR.References(1) Smith, C.; Hill, A.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe synthesis of green ammonia will be a steppingstone toward a sustainable and safe future. It not only finds applications as an agricultural fertilizer but is also being explored in energy storage domains. To sustainably utilize ammonia in these applications, alternate processes are required which can alleviate the massive carbon footprint and energy utilization, unlike the conventional Haber-Bosch process. Electrochemical synthesis of ammonia helps to make the process green by consuming renewable resources for electricity consumption. The proposed work aims to study electrochemical calcium-mediated ammonia synthesis (Ca-MAS). The reaction proceeds with the electrodeposition of calcium metal on the different substrates which subsequently undergoes nitridation and then finally leads to the formation of ammonia. Li-mediated synthesis of ammonia has been explored greatly by varying various parameters and enhancing performance but since Li is very reactive it is limited by safety issues associated with it. Calcium is expected to demonstrate a superior performance since it has a lower equilibrium potential for deposition, unlike lithium, and will assist in obtaining better energy efficiencies. Moreover, it is 10,000 times more abundant than Lithium, therefore, economically lucrative. Various substrates for Ca deposition have been studied to optimize the system's performance. Copper coated on nickel mesh is identified as the most promising substrate. It has been inferred that the thickness of copper on different substrates plays a major role and optimum thickness is needed to balance the trade-off between very less availability of copper to form the nitride and too much copper to impede the dinitrogen transportation. 50nm has been identified as the optimum thickness for this case. Various electrolyte compositions are studied with varying base electrolytes such as THF, propylene carbonate, acetonitrile, and Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) based on their volatility, conductivity, and stability and their effect on the performance in terms of FE and current densities have been analyzed. Achieving almost similar yields and current efficiencies as Lithium-mediated will significantly lower the costs associated with the entire process and make it even more benign.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDirect electrochemical conversion of CO2capture solutions (instead of gaseous CO2) into valuable chemicals can circumvent the energy-intensive CO2regeneration and pressurization steps. While commonly used CO2capture agents include alkali and amine solutions, ammonia has been rarely investigated. In another aspect, mismanagement of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in waste has emerged as a major problem in water pollution to our ecosystems, causing severe eutrophication and health concerns. Sustainably recovering Nr [such as nitrate (NO3−)-N] and converting it into green ammonia (NH3) could mitigate the environmental impacts of Nr and reduce the NH3demand from the carbon-intensive Haber-Bosch process, as well as a possible CO2capture agent due to its alkaline nature. In this talk, we will present our rencet research on integration of electrodialysis and electrocatalysis for ammonia synthesis from dilute waste Nr sources, and green ammonia-mediated CO2capture (to ammonium bicarbonate, NH4HCO3) and subsequent reduction to ammonium formate (NH4HCO2) as a new approach to CO2capture and utilization (CCU). We have demonstrated a record-high NO3−-to-NH3performance in a scalable, versatile, and cost-effective membrane-free alkaline electrolyzer (MFAEL): an unprecedented NH3partial current density of 4.22 ± 0.25 A cm−2with a faradaic efficiency of 84.5 ± 4.9%. We also discovered that an ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3)-fed electrolyzer with an anion exchange membrane (AEM) outperforms the state-of-the-art KHCO3electrolyzer with a bipolar membrane (BPM) owing to its favorable thermal decomposition property, which allows for a 3-fold increase in thein-situCO2concentration, a maximum 23% increase in formate faradaic efficiency, and a 35% reduction in cell voltage by substituting BPM with the AEM. Our integrated process by combining NH4HCO3electrolysis with CO2capturing by on-site generated green ammonia from the electro-reduction of nitrate in MFAEL has shown a remarkable 99.8% utilization of CO2capturing agent. Such a multi-purpose process may offer a sustainable route for the simultaneous removal of Nrwastes and streamlined CO2capturing and upgrading to valuable chemicals.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEnergetic electrons in dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) have been proposed to collide with and activate the N2triple bond,1enabling ambient NH3synthesis powered by renewable electricity but plagued by low energy yields, even with heterogenous catalysts. Porous oxides exhibit similar N2conversions with or without supported metal nanoparticles,2indicating significant support contributions that need to be quantified. We synthesized SBA-153(a silica-based ordered mesoporous material (OMM) with tunable pore sizes) to probe porosity effects on N2conversion and plasma properties (i.e., electron densities). γ-alumina has not been similarly studied due to complex OMM syntheses and their lower surface areas, despite its higher dielectric constant (that improves DBD-catalyst synergy) and acid sites (that are catalytically active and adsorb product NH3). We coated SBA-15 with different γ-alumina loadings3(5-15 wt. % Al) for the desired surface functionality on an identical framework, which all displayed complete coverage of the SBA-15 surface and ordered porosity, as evidenced from FTIR and N2physisorption, respectively. A sharp decrease in pore size and surface area indicated 10 wt. % Al is the threshold loading for a relatively thin coating. This composite, alongside SBA-15, was pressed and sieved into 1-2 mm pellets to promote beneficial packing in the DBD reactor, in which they exhibited similar N2conversions. However, shielding NH3from decomposition was only demonstrated for the composite, as evidenced from temperature-swing desorption after reaction, similar to effects observed on zeolites.4Both OMM pellets exhibited higher N2conversions relative to pelletized powders of non-ordered oxides, consistent with previous results for silica.5The composite also showed higher conversion than commonly used beads (silica and γ-alumina) despite the fact that interparticle voids between the smaller OMM pellets likely inhibit plasma generation (i.e., higher breakdown voltage) hence a partial discharge. This is in agreement with the lower electron densities and N2conversions measured on pelletized commercial samples relative to beads. These results inform the rational design of OMM porosity and functionality to optimize plasma properties, catalytic activity, NH3uptake, and therefore the energy yield of DBD-assisted catalysis.References(1) Mehta, P.; Barboun, P.

Plasma-assisted hydrogen cyanide (HCN) synthesis from dilute CH4streams is a promising route to methane feedstock underutilization. The potential of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) nitrogen (N2)/CH4plasma for decentralized catalyst-free selective HCN production at ambient temperature conditions paired with renewable energy sources, renders it compelling compared to existing processes. In this work, we evaluate the suitability of N2/CH4DBD plasma for selective HCN production, investigating the correlation between operating parameters, HCN and ethane (C2H6) yield and energy consumption (EHCN). We demonstrate that HCN selectivity is favored by low initial CH4concentration. For further insight into parametric effects on radical induced chemistry, we develop a microkinetic model, establishing that a simplified reaction network with a significantly reduced number of active plasma species can reliably replicate yield trends. We then discuss the reactions and crucial intermediates governing HCN and C2H6synthesis across experimental conditions. Finally, we compare this process to current industrial ones, regardingEHCNand CO2equivalent emissions, showing that N2/CH4DBD plasma can achieve minimal CO2emissions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe transition towards the decarbonized, sustainable chemical engineering industry is challenging due to the fundamental reliance of the chemical sector on petrochemical feedstocks. Production of critical chemical building blocks by electrochemical methods, powered with renewable sources of energy, is a rapidly evolving technology that could drastically reduce CO2emissions from the chemical sector. However, it has been extremely challenging to showcase a cost-competitive chemical production by means of CO2 electrolysis (CO2R). We present here an alternative strategy: initial use of CO2R to generate an extremely high-value product, namely carbon dioxide stream enriched in the rare isotope of carbon 13C. We have discovered that direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide and electrochemical reduction of CO2can be modified so they will concurrently produce a carbon dioxide enriched in the stable13C isotope (patent WO2022271103A2). Our technology is simple to implement, requires minimal modification of existing reactors and does affect their function, and will easily scale to the current production capacity of13C isotopically labeled chemicals and beyond. The techno-economic analysis shows that CO2R-based separation of13C isotope could drastically decrease the cost of production of13C enriched streams (by a factor of 100). The excellent economic case of electrolysis-based isotopes separation will support investment into electrochemistry in general, which will lead to the improvement of the electrochemical reactors performance, decrease the investment cost, necessary to penetrate chemicals and fuels production markets.The benefits of such a synergistic development would span across several sectors and be an important stepping stone in the pursuit of Net Zero 2050 goal.References:[1] Barecka and Ager.Towards an accelerated decarbonization of the chemical industry by electrolysis.Energy Adv., 2023,2, 268-279[2] Patent WO2022271103A2",

    "abstract": "AbstractIntegrating CO2capture and utilization using electrochemical methods is a promising approach to addressing current energy and climate challenges.1, 2Conventional gas-fed membrane-based CO2electrolyzers have shown promise in this aspect, but several key challenges must be overcome for successful commercialization: i) large pH gradients that result in conversion of CO2into (bi)carbonate at the cathode and subsequent release of CO2at the anode,3ii) the degradation of polymeric membranes,4and iii) the decreased performance of membranes and electrodes caused by deposition of impurity species.5In this work, we demonstrate a design of packed-bed membraneless electrolyzers (PBME) with a series of alternating porous electrodes to simultaneously address these three issues. By flowing a bicarbonate electrolyte resembling a carbon-capture solution through proton-generating anodes and CO2reduction cathodes, the pH of the electrolyte was balanced between electrodes while CO2was generated immediately upstream of the cathode, as evidenced by in-situ colorimetric imaging measurements.6This helps minimize the back-conversion from CO2to (bi)carbonate that results in low CO2conversion per pass. We show that the PBME design is scalable and that CO2utilization is expected to exceed 80% in an optimized multi-cell system. By adding chelating agents to scavenge metal impurities and ultra-thin metal oxide layers to encapsulate the electrocatalysts, impurity deposition was minimized and the electrode stability was significantly enhanced, as evidenced by electrochemical and product measurements, as well as electrode characterization. We also evaluated operations at elevated pressures, where the performance is expected to be improved due to the higher solubility of CO2, hence resulting in a larger amount of CO2that can participate in the reaction.This work demonstrates a simple, affordable, and scalable electrolyzer design that will enable the decarbonization of energy-intensive industrial processes through electrification in a sustainable energy future.References(1) Gutiérrez-Sánchez, O.; Bohlen, B.; Daems, N.; Bulut, M.; Pant, D.; Breugelmans, T.

The technical portion of this talk will highlight new avenues in adjacent fields that build on microreaction engineering fundamentals. For instance, a lack of available experimental methods has limited, until recently, the field of gas hydrates. A deeper understanding of their crystallizations in confinement is now possible by introducing a methodology for the measurement of kinetics. A phenomenon called non-photochemical laser induced nucleation, discovered in the mid-1990s, remains a mystery that microreactors are now helping to better understand. Many of the early drivers for designing small-scale flow reactors in the first place parallel their recent application for reactions with plasmas, which are complicated, lightning fast, and uncharted waters in terms of the reaction chemistry. Rethinking how we perform laboratory experiments, synchronous with computers, also has the potential to make conventional research, development, and the manufacture of synthetic polymerizations greener. The techniques and tools in the microreaction engineering discipline are evolving data-centric, with continued emphasis on the development of predictive models from first-principles.

In this presentation, several flow chemistry case studies from Small Molecule Process Research and Development at Merck will be highlighted to illustrate how chemical reaction engineering approaches lead to innovative solutions for the manufacturing of drug substance materials. Using the work of the Klavs Jensen Lab as an aspirational model, this presentation will show how industrial research has similarly progressed from using flow chemistry as a process intensification tool for traditional chemical reactions to a powerful and enabling technology to build complex molecules.The first case study will review challenges and learnings from scaling up a reaction with rapid kinetics and an unstable intermediate. Merck’s development work on this project leveraged fundamental engineering knowledge, often taking guidance from research in the Jensen Lab, to build the framework for expanded use of flow reactions across scales. With the adoption of flow reaction tools in process chemistry, methods to streamline synthesis of API by integrating flow chemistry with nascent technologies have been explored. Case studies around flow processes that leveraged immobilized biocatalysis and photochemistry will be presented to illustrate such synergies.

    "abstract": "AbstractSmall-scale flow reactors support the shift in chemical manufacture towards green and sustainable processes, especially since the small reactor length scales enable the transition to chemical activation via renewable energy sources, e.g. photo- and electrochemistry [1,2].Nevertheless, there is still intensification potential for both processes. Photochemistry is often performed in two-phase flow, and the presence of a non-absorbing phase significantly reduces the photochemical efficiency. In a preliminary study, we developed a multizone photochemical reactor model which predicts that the largest reactivity is observed in the vicinity of the dispersed phase, and not in the bulk liquid slug in Taylor flow [3]. Thus, to further enhance the reactor efficiency and to increase its throughput the two-phase contacting pattern needs to be better controlled. Similar optimization potential is also present for electrochemical microreactors: As the flow is laminar diffusion is the only mechanism by which electroactive material reaches the electrodes. In a preliminary study we created an operation regime map of parallel plate electrochemical microreactors based on literature published since 2000, which clearly revealed that the throughput in electrochemical reactors is imposed by diffusion mass transfer limitations [4]. Consequently, to further intensify electrochemical flow reactors and to go beyond the diffusion limits, active mixing is necessary.In this talk I will present our recent approaches to use ultrasound actuation to overcome the aforementioned transport limitations. We focus on a holistic approach to exploit acoustic resonance and characterize the synergistic effects of ultrasound in electro- and photochemical reactions.References[1] Hoffmann, N.

In this talk, I will present a 'self-driving fluidic lab (SDFL)' for autonomous discovery and manufacturing of emerging advanced functional materials and molecules, with multi-step chemistries, through integration of flow chemistry, online characterization, and machine learning (ML). I will discuss how modularization of different chemical synthesis and processing stages in tandem with a constantly evolving ML modeling and decision-making under uncertainty can enable a resource-efficient navigation through high dimensional experimental design spaces (>1020possible experimental conditions). Example applications of SDFL for the autonomous synthesis of clean energy nanomaterials and specialty chemicals will be presented to illustrate the potential of autonomous robotic experimentation in reducing synthetic route discovery timeframe from >10 years to a few months. Finally, I will present the unique reconfigurability aspect of flow chemistry to close the scale gap in chemical and materials research through facile switching from the reaction exploration/exploitation to smart manufacturing mode.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWater is a byproduct of many emerging reactions in green chemistry (e.g., as an environmentally friendly leaving group), a desirable solvent, and a major constituent of biomass feedstocks. As a result, designing solid Bronsted acid catalysts that are stable and active around liquid water is critical for these various applications driven by sustainable chemistry agendas. In this work, strong acidity, hydrophobicity, and confinement were integrated into a solid material by functionalizing the intrapore voids of the siliceous Beta-framework molecular sieve with phenethyl-sulfonic acid sites (PE-Betas). These PE-Betas were evaluated as catalysts in the hydroxyalkylation/alkylation reaction of 2-methylfuran with acetone as a representative biomass upgrading reaction that generates a stoichiometric amount of liquid water. Compared to conventional aluminosilicate Betas, phenethyl-sulfonic acid-functionalized mesoporous SiO2 gel, and commercial sulfonic acid catalysts, the PE-Betas showed superior turnover numbers (TON) due to the combination of high acid site strength and hydrophobicity that arises from the confined PE groups. Further, the hydrophobicity and TON over PE-Betas were invariant with acid site density, showing that these materials effectively decouple the active site density−hydrophilicity relationship that is a fundamental limitation of conventional zeolites. These sulfonic acid-functionalized molecular sieves represent a distinct class of water-tolerant, strong Bronsted acid catalysts that may be well suited for a wide range of reactions that occur in or near liquid water. Looking ahead, achieving such tailored, multifunctional catalytic materials for diverse chemical processes in practice will require the development of advanced synthetic techniques, which is a core aim of ongoing efforts in our research.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAlloys comprised of an early transition metal dispersed in a coinage metal can provide opportunities for effecting selective chemical transformations of organic oxygenates. In this talk, I will discuss our recent work to synthesize dilute Ti-Cu(111) surface alloys in ultrahigh vacuum and characterize their structural and chemical properties using experiments and DFT. Scanning tunneling microscopy shows that Cu-capped, Ti-containing islands are preferentially generated on step edges of Cu(111) during Ti deposition below ~500 K, but that Ti atoms incorporate into the step edges during deposition above 500 K, generating a dilute Ti-Cu(111) surface alloy. In agreement with DFT, distinct C-O stretch bands were observed using surface vibrational spectroscopy for CO adsorbed on Cu-capped, Ti ensembles vs. isolated Ti atoms alloyed into the Cu(111) surface.We also find that dilute Ti-Cu(111) surfaces are highly selective for the deoxygenation of ethanol. Temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy shows that ethanol deoxygenates on Ti-Cu(111) surfaces to produce only gaseous ethylene (C2H4) and H2near 400 K. The O released during reaction remains bound to Ti atoms, resulting in the formation of surface TiOxmoieties and a shift in reaction selectivity toward acetaldehyde formation. DFT calculations corroborate the high selectivity of metallic Ti-Cu(111) surfaces toward ethanol deoxygenation and predict that ethoxy deoxygenation and C2H4desorption become significantly favored as the Ti ensemble size is increased from monomers to trimers, and that the O released during C-O bond cleavage causes destabilization of the adsorbed C2H4product and hinderance of further dehydrogenation, both of which facilitate desorption of the desired C2H4product. Our findings provide insights about the structural and chemical properties of dilute Ti-Cu(111) surfaces, revealing their propensity for promoting alcohol deoxygenation to alkenes and showing how the nuclearity and formation of reaction intermediates can influence the chemistry promoted by atomic-scale Ti ensembles in Cu.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSingle-atom alloys have shown strong catalytic performance for several types of reactions, including hydrogenation reactions and alkane conversion. However, single-atom alloys have not been extensively studied for oxidation reactions, despite the critical importance of these reactions. The possibility that single-atom alloys could easily activate molecular oxygen but bind O relatively weakly makes them intriguing, as weakly bound O is likely to be quite reactive. In this work, we computationally designed single-atom alloys for oxidation, focusing on surfaces that can easily activate O2but give relatively weak O binding. We found several Ag- and Au-based single atom alloys can activate O2with very low barriers, in some cases near 0, while still binding O relatively weakly. Subsequent experimental synthesis and testing of single-crystal single-atom alloy surfaces shows that single-atom alloys can activate O2and O can subsequently spillover onto the inert host sites. Characterization with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and temperature-programmed desorption gives strong fundamental insight into the interaction of these materials with oxygen and their state when exposed to oxygen and a reductant. Finally, single-atom alloy nanoparticles were synthesized and tested, and show excellent performance for oxidation reactions. This work demonstrates the utility of integrated computational-experimental studies, and opens up the possibility of high-performance single-atom alloy catalysts for many oxidation reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo circumvent energy-intensive syngas-mediated methane (CH4) upgrading routes to liquid chemicals, CH4partial oxidation (MPO) to methanol with subsequent methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) presents as an enticing pathway. However, MPO with O2often leads to overoxidation to CO and CO2. Gold-palladium (AuPd) nanoparticles are promising catalysts for CH4upgrading, as they are active for MPO by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and H2O2synthesis from H2and O2. Encapsulation of AuPd metal within microporous zeolite frameworks is attractive for maximizing metal surface area and enabling tandem reactions (MTH) on zeolitic acid sites, but requires development of synthesis strategies for zeolite-encapsulated AuPd nanoparticles. Here, encapsulated metal in MFI and BEA (Au, Pd, AuPd@Zeolite) are prepared via direct hydrothermal syntheses utilizing 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane to ligate metal precursors during zeolite crystallization. These samples are compared with metal supported post-synthetically on BEA zeolite. Powder X-ray diffraction indicates that encapsulated metal nanoparticle-zeolite catalysts are well-crystallized, and transmission electron microscopy reveals well-dispersed nanoparticles (dTEM= 1-3 nm). Further, diffuse reflectance UV-vis suggests a prevalence of alloy AuPd nanoparticles, as the localized surface plasmon resonance band indicative of bulk gold (~500 nm) is absent from AuPd@Zeolite spectra. Encapsulation efficiencies were measured through oxidation rates of small alcohols relative to bulky alcohols that cannot access zeolitic micropores as well as small alcohol oxidation in the presence of bulky titrants. In MPO experiments, BEA-supported Pd catalysts exhibited enhanced selectivity toward methanol versus Au, but unproductive H2O2disproportionation also increased. Relative to Au and Pd monometallic catalysts, the bimetallic AuPd catalyst yielded increased selectivity to methanol, which is attributed to Au-Pd electronic interactions mitigating overoxidation of liquid oxygenates. Finally, Brønsted acidic HBEA supports inhibit unproductive H2O2decomposition over NaBEA analogs. Insights from these tailored catalyst syntheses can be applied to other metals and zeolite frameworks for more precise syntheses of thermally stable bifunctional catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPropane dehydrogenation is a major process involved in the production of petrochemicals via the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This reaction, and other propane conversion reactions, requires a catalytic material that can activate propane while mitigating coking on the surface and cracking of hydrocarbons. While past work indicates that single-atom alloys (which consist of one metal doped as single atoms into the surface of another metal) can meet both of these criteria, single-atom alloys with higher performance are needed to improve the overall process efficiency; further, these improved single-atom alloys could be effective catalysts for other challenging alkane conversion reactions. Because experimental screening of catalysts is generally expensive and time-consuming, we used density functional theory (DFT) to computationally examine the behavior of different single-atom alloy catalyst for propane conversion. The IrAg single-atom alloy is predicted to be effective for propane conversion, but is not predicted to be stable. To address this stability issue, we found that trimetallic Ag-based surfaces can stabilize the Ir single-atom site while maintaining similar energetics as IrAg. This strategy of using bimetallic hosts to stabilize single-atom sites greatly opens up the space of useable single-atom alloys. We also found that a TiCu single-atom alloy surface is predicted to be effective for propane dehydrogenation, partly due to agostic (i.e., C-H-M) interactions. Thus, this work identifies promising catalytic surfaces for alkane conversion, with possible applications in more delicate and selective reactions such as alkane coupling, and also develops new strategies for designing stable single-atom sites with desired reactivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSingle atom alloys (SAAs) can break the typical linear free energy scaling relationships found in other mono- and bi- metallic catalysts because there is an absence of homonuclear metal coordination. One of the main drawbacks of SAAs is their limited applications due to small per-volume and per-area of active sites. One reaction that makes use of these SAAs is the direct synthesis of H2O2(from H2and O2) on AuPd SAA catalysts. Prior work on large SAA AuPd materials have shown that isolated Pd atoms selectively make H2O2, while Pd ensembles form undesired H2O. In this collaborative effort, our work uses density functional theory (DFT) to understand the structure of small AuPd catalysts (~2 nm) and how Pd atoms prefer to arrange as a function of nanoparticle size, composition, and reaction conditions. Pd most favorably exchanges into the subsurface sites of Au nanoparticles (in vacuum), and Pd exchange becomes less favorable when Pd is present at neighboring sites (Fig. 1a). Thus, Pd preferentially locates in the subsurface of the particle and isolated from each other. However, adsorption energies for O* and CO* become more favorable when Pd is present in the adsorption site (Fig. 1b); such species are likely to drive Pd atoms to the surface. Here, we use Monte Carlo methods to simulate how the particle might change in the presence of adsorbates. For example, CO (1 bar) changes the average Pd coordination number from 12 to ~8 and increases the composition of the surface from ~0% Au to ~20% Pd (Fig. 1c). These results will be expanded to include solvent and solvent-derived adsorbates (e.g., OH*) and compared to ex situ and in situ characterizations (FTIR, XAS) and used to inform kinetic studies exploring the effects of reaction conditions and pretreatments on SAA performance in H2O2synthesis reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe production of ethanol has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its application as a fuel. Hydrogenation of methyl acetate is potentially a more sustainable route for ethanol production compared to the common corn-to-ethanol pathway. Copper based catalysts have been utilized to selectively produce ethanol and methanol from methyl acetate, but these catalysts are limited by low activity. An approach that has been used to improve the activity of metals with low activity but high selectivity like copper is the introduction of active metals like platinum in dilute quantities. Here, Pt is expected to increase activity by accelerating dissociative adsorption of H2. In this study, we introduced dilute quantities of platinum (0.3 – 0.6wt%) to a Cu/SiO2catalyst using the galvanic replacement method. This method involves the introduction of the Pt precursor to the reduced Cu/SiO2in solution leading to a redox process in which Pt atoms are reduced to the surface and Cu atoms are oxidized into solution. The Pt-Cu/SiO2catalysts led to improved activity for the methyl acetate hydrogenation reaction while still maintaining good selectivity to the ethanol product as compared to the native Cu/SiO2catalyst. Hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction results show that introducing platinum improved the reducibility of the Cu/SiO2catalysts. This improved reducibility as seen from lower reduction temperatures suggests that even at very low quantities, Pt can improve hydrogen dissociation and spillover leading to improved activity. However, introducing dilute quantities of Pt to smaller supported Cu nanoparticles prepared by the ammonia evaporation method led to a decline in activity. Thus, the effect of Pt on activity is sensitive to particle size suggesting that the role of Pt may be more complex for small Cu nanoparticles, and that small Cu nanoparticles possess sites with unique reactivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractManipulating the interactions between precious metal nanoparticles and metal oxide supports is crucial for advancing heterogeneous catalysis. Specifically, the use of strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), which involves encapsulating group VIII metal nanoparticles with reducible metal oxides (such as TiO2, Fe3O4) under H2at elevated temperatures, is an effective strategy for fine-tuning the activity, selectivity, and stability of nanoparticles. However, the SMSI effects on alloy nanoparticles have received little attention to date. To address this gap, we synthesized core/shell nanoparticles with a PdAg core wrapped by a FeOxshell (denoted as PdAg/FeOx) and triggered the SMSI effect by treating PdAg/FeOxunder H2flow at 300 °C (denoted PdAg/FeOx-H). By employing atomic-resolution electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we studied the SMSI effect on PdAg alloy and observed different behaviors between Pd and Ag atoms. Subsequently, we utilized PdAg/FeOx-H nanoparticles for acetylene semi-hydrogenation into ethylene. Under a feed gas of 0.5% C2H2in Ar, the PdAg/FeOx-H exhibited >99% acetylene conversion and >95% ethylene selectivity at 130°C. We attribute the excellent selectivity towards ethylene to the SMSI effect, which created a special confinement and weakened C2H4adsorption over the PdAg surface. In summary, our work opens the door for studying SMSI behavior over alloy nanoparticles and applying it to important reactions, including but not limited to, the hydrogenation of alkynes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA seeded encapsulation synthesis method was developed to facilitate precise, multifactor tuning of mesoporous silica-encapsulated gold core-shell nanoparticles (Au@SiO2CSNPs). The new seeded method prevents the Stöber synthesis portion of the reaction from impacting the gold core diameter. Altering the Stöber synthesis conditions thusly results in core-shell nanoparticles with different shell morphologies, without affecting the gold active phase. Because of this, remarkably simple catalytic studies can be performed to investigate the specific impact of pore morphology on catalytic performance. Both silica pore diameter and shell thickness (corresponding to pore length) were varied. The Au@SiO2CSNPs were used to catalyze the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. This is a common catalyst benchmark reaction, with the objective of maximizing selectivity towards benzaldehyde and minimizing the formation of further oxidized products (i.e., benzyl benzoate). The further oxidized products are more thermodynamically favored, resulting in an inverse relationship between conversion and selectivity towards the aldehyde product.Alteration of pore length, via a control of the silica condensation kinetics, demonstrated that increasing pore length led to increased activities and selectivities for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Increasing pore width, via the use of swelling agents, increased activity at the cost of selectivity. This approach permitted, for the first time, a careful control of several morphological parameters without impacting each other. Molecular spectroscopy (FTIR and NMR) indicate that this is likely due to a microphase separation, via weak adsorption to the pore wall, providing for beneficial in-pore orientation and preferential mass transport. Thus, this platform enables fundamental catalytic investigations into pore geometry and catalyst design.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMany electrocatalytic processes of contemporary interest, including H2evolution and CO2reduction, must be coupled with an anodic oxidation reaction to create a working device. The anodic oxidation reaction must be efficiently performed at scale over an earth­abundant anode electrocatalyst to ensure commercial viability. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media is a promising candidate reaction, since it can be performed over earth-abundant nickel-iron (oxy)hydroxide (NiFe) electrocatalysts with activity comparable to what is observed over Ir and Ru oxides in acidic media. However, driving OER over NiFe still requires an excessive overpotential, limiting the overall efficiency of many electrocatalytic processes. There has been considerable interest in understanding the structural and electronic evolution of NiFe during OER and identifying the role of Fe in promoting electrocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, many questions regarding the structure of this catalyst and the electronic state of the constituent metals of this electrocatalyst remain, despite these efforts. These ambiguities have hindered the rational design of superior electrocatalysts. One of the challenges has been to precisely control the electrocatalyst composition in the low iron concentration regime (1 to 20 at. % Fe) and identifying the oxidation state of Fe during OER. In this study, we discuss the cause of Fe enrichment observed in electrodeposited NiFe electrocatalysts and leverage this knowledge to design a new synthesis procedure that enables exceptional control over electrocatalyst composition throughout the entire composition range. We use this approach to investigate the role of both catalyst composition and thickness on electrocatalytic activity, coupled with synchrotron-based soft x-ray spectroscopy to investigate the oxidation state of Fe.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPt-based bimetallic alloys, especially Pt3Ni, have shown a considerable increase in the activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to commercial Pt/C. However, opportunities to increase activity further are limited due to their relatively small design space. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have recently been demonstrated to be promising as catalysts for many different chemistries and their enormous, near-continuous design space presents an opportunity for rational catalyst design.In this work, we present a first-principles analysis of Pt-based HEA catalysts with non-precious elements (Fe, Ni, Co, and Cu), which we have determined to be experimentally active for the ORR. Based on our experimental STEM-EDX results—which show that multilayer Pt-skins form in the near-surface region due to leaching of non-precious metals—we first probe the influence of ligand and ensemble effects on the activity by calculating binding energies of ORR intermediates like OH and OOH (using DFT) as a function of the number of Pt-skin layers on thousands of HEA active sites. Second, we examine the effect of near-surface strain relaxation on the ORR activity, and we find that the two effects compete with each other. Finally, we incorporate these effects into a theoretical activity calculation and find that the ORR activities of almost all the active sites follow the traditional ORR volcano relationship.Based on these rigorous analyses, we rationalize bulk strain as a simple descriptor for the ORR activity and present a simplified strain-based volcano analysis to optimize catalytic activity. By mapping composition to strain using a Vegard’s law-type relation, we identify an HEA composition with optimal activity, synthesize it, and find that it shows a current density (per area) about 10 times that of Pt, thus validating our theoretical prediction. We close by discussing potential machine learning-based strategies to accelerate the design of HEAs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical ozone production (EOP) is a potential green alternative route for ozone (O3) generation for advanced oxidation processes and water purification.Nickel and antimony doped tin oxide (NATO) is a promising EOP active catalyst due to its high selectivity and low toxicity.Currently, the mechanism of EOP on NATO electrodes is unclear. In addition, the role of dopants in inducing EOP activity in otherwise inactive tin oxide is not understood.High EOP selectivity is fundamentally unexpected since the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is thermodynamically favored due to its lower potential (1.23 for OER vs 1.51 V for EOP). EOP is usually assumed to be a surface-mediated reaction that proceeds parallel to OER. Many mechanisms, which attribute unique activities to different antimony and nickel species, have been suggested to explain the high reaction selectivity. However, direct experimental verification of proposed mechanisms has been challenging.In this work, we build on previous reports to establish the mechanism of EOP on NATO electrodes. Previous studies showed that increasing the thickness of NATO electrodes increases selectivity and output, which suggested that non-surface bound intermediates play an active role in EOP. We further support this hypothesis using isotopic labeling and chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Our measurements demonstrate the participation of lattice oxygen in EOP and show that EOP is a non-surface bound reaction. We use x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to explain the role of antimony in terms of its oxidation state. In addition, we study the structure of NATO electrodes using x-ray diffraction to understand the catalyst activity. We show that co-doping tin oxide with antimony and nickel generates unique active sites that are responsible for ozone activity Based on our findings, we predicted dopants with higher EOP performance and successfully synthesized improved doped tin oxide catalysts .",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogen gas is a critical industrial chemical and energy-dense fuel that is expected to play a vital role in the decarbonization of our economy as society tackles the growing threat of climate change. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is an attractive, carbon-free process that uses renewable electricity to produce “green” hydrogen from water. To meet the growing global demand for green hydrogen, improvements to PEMWE costs and efficiencies are critical. An area of significant potential for reducing costs and improving energy efficiency is oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. Only iridium (Ir)-based materials have been accepted as both active and stable catalysts for the OER under the acidic conditions of a PEMWE. Given the expensive and scarce nature of Ir, our research aims to maximize the intrinsic activity and stability of catalysts while simultaneously minimizing their Ir content, to limit both the material and operating electricity costs of PEMWE. We report our investigation on a series of tunable crystalline M3IrO7(M=Pr, Nd, Eu, Sm) materials to offer fundamental understanding and characterization of Ir 5+ catalysts for the OER. Leveraging X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction refinement, we characterize and compare the geometric properties and Ir environments across the series of M3IrO7materials, with the ultimate goal of relating intrinsic OER performance with geometric and electronic properties of the catalysts to determine fundamental structure-function relationships. We additionally investigate dissolution behavior of these compounds under OER conditions, report S-numbers as an intrinsic stability metric, and offer context to other standard Ir-based OER catalyst materials. To elucidate fundamental relationships between stability and geometric and electronic structure properties, we relate material stability in acidic conditions to Ir-O bond covalency, lattice structure, and M-site cation species. Our work aims to inform future Ir-based catalyst development for ultimate high-efficiency hydrogen production via PEMWE.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an important process for electrocatalysis, particularly in fuel cells. The metal-water interface is a crucial factor that affects the efficiency of the ORR process, particularly in alkaline media where water is a reactant, making it challenging to determine the proton-electron transfer (PET) barrier.Recently, a method for calculating the PET barrier has been proposed, which combines bond order conservation, EVB theory, and Marcus theory [1]. This approach allows for an accurate and efficient calculation of electron transfer kinetics. In this study, we apply this method to analyze the ORR kinetics on Pt(111) surfaces in alkaline media. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations andab-initiomolecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we investigate the ORR kinetics on Pt(111) surfaces by considering the changes in coverage with respect to the potential. We observe the ORR kinetic changes in each region and elucidate the mechanism. Our study reveals the importance of the dynamic fluctuation of solvent water molecules at room temperature, which significantly affects the ORR kinetics. Our findings provide a more precise theoretical rate and demonstrate the importance of understanding the metal-water interface in electrocatalytic processes, particularly in alkaline media, which can guide the design of efficient electrocatalysts for various technological applications.[1] J.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe direct synthesis of H2O2 through the two-electron oxygen reduction is limited by further reduction of OOH* to H2O through the four-electron pathway. Single atom catalysts embedded in nitrogen-doped-carbon are promising materials for the two-electron reduction because of their exquisitely tuneable active sites. Using characterisation studies, electrochemical measurements, and first principles calculations, we elucidate how tailoring environments beyond the binding site of Fe, Ni, and Co single atom catalysts alters selectivity. Isolated Ni sites confined by amino anthraquinone demonstrate an 80% faradaic efficiency to the two-electron reduction across a wide-range of potential. Similar faradaic efficiencies are also obtained on the Ni-N3S1motif. First principles calculations indicate that amino anthraquinone physisorbs on Ni sites, creating a ~3.2 Å wide nano-channel within which reaction intermediates are confined. These confinement effects weaken the OOH* adsorption strength, thus favouring desorption over further reduction. For the sulfur modified Ni sites, we leverage XPS, XAS, and TEM characterisation studies to create a computational library of active site motifs having progressively increasing extents of site oxidation. First principles calculations reveal that while replacing nitrogen with sulfur within the first coordination shell strengthens OOH* adsorption energies, progressive oxidation of the active site has a weakening effect. The net effect results in OOH* desorption being favoured over further dissociation, thus confirming the experimentally observed selectivity on the sulfur-modified catalysts. The weakening of OOH* adsorption strengths through sulfur modification and site oxidation also results in Co sites that are ordinarily selective towards the four-electron pathway, becoming more selective towards two-electron reduction. Despite inducing structural changes beyond the binding site such as confinement effects, sulfur modification, and site oxidation, a linear scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of OOH* and OH* is observed. This scaling relationship indicates that even such structural changes cannot circumvent reactivity limitations imposed by the Sabatier volcano.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOne of the largest challenges in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is the homogeneous oxidation of the C2+products with O2, forming COxand lowering selectivity. Therefore, membrane/catalyst systems can potentially increase OCM selectivity compared to traditional reactors by replacing O2cofeed with controllable O2-feed. However, the most promising OCM catalysts (based on Na2WO4) have been difficult to integrate into O2--permeable membrane systems: to our knowledge, there has never been a rigorous demonstration of a membrane/Na2WO4catalyst system that outperforms a standard packed bed reactor of the state-of-the-art Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2catalyst. One key challenge is parasitic reactions of oxygen to form COx, whether in the gas phase due to O2(g), or on the membrane: state-of-the-art O2membranes, like Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-x, BaCoxFeyZrzO3-xor La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-x(LSCF), catalyze deeper methane oxidation. Furthermore, Na2WO4is incompatible with these membranes due to formation of additional transport-blocking phases, like BaWO4or SrWO4. Given these challenges (and requirements for high reaction rates), a hybrid multi-layered membrane based on separate oxides with different functionalities is a promising strategy. In this work, we tackle these challenges by applying interlayer films of several oxides to LSCF hollow fiber membranes. These films enhance reaction rates, C2+selectivity, and stability compared to the LSCF-only case. We demonstrate that by using Bi1.5Y0.3Sm0.2O3-xas a relatively inert buffer interlayer, and Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2as a catalyst, we can achieve 57% C2+selectivity at 21% CH4conversion at 850 °C, with improved stability compared to the LSCF-only case. This is among the best performances demonstrated for an Na2WO4-based membrane/catalyst system. Our findings stress the importance of minimizing (i) the detrimental effects of excessive O2(g), (ii) non-selective membrane OCM contributions, and (iii) transport-inhibiting solid-state reactions between components. Based on these, we present a kinetic-modelling-based framework for optimizing OCM performance of multifunctional membrane/catalyst systems closer towards technoeconomic relevance.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe direct partial oxidation of methane to primary oxygenates such as methanol suffers from impractically low product yields due to over-oxidation of the desired product to CO2under the reaction conditions necessary for methane activation [1-2]. The derivatization of methanol to oxidation-resistant methyl esters in concentrated acid solvents is a successfully demonstrated product protection strategy that can maintain high product selectivity independent of conversion extent [3]. Still, there are a number of critical shortcomings left unaddressed, including: the reliance on molecular Pt-group catalysts, economically infeasible oxidants (e.g. K2S2O8), and the use of corrosive, fully concentrated acid solvents [4].In the current contribution, new developments to some of the key shortcomings of these processes are presented, namely active heterogeneous catalyst that perform the conversion in a diluted acid medium with pressurized air as the oxidant source. Under our improved reaction conditions, facilely synthesized Co/SiO2and Mn/TiO2display competitive performance on the basis ester production rates (up to 245 and 613 µmol gcat-1h-1, respectively) with negligible metal leaching in comparison to previously reported homogeneously-catalyzed systems that employ stronger oxidants and higher methane partial pressures. [5-6]. Through a combination of characterization techniques, correlations between catalytic activity and the distribution of metal species in the catalyst can be derived. The conclusion of the contribution underscores impactful directions for further developing high-yield methane conversion processes through more holistic consideration of catalysts, reagents, and operating conditions.[1] M.

The synthesis gas with the H2/CO ratio of 1.5-2 is used as a feedstock in the Fischer-Tropsch process for the synthesis of various essential chemicals, including dimethyl ether (DME), higher alkenes, methanol, and substitute natural gas (SNG), etc., In this study, a very high surface area (670 m2/g) of Zr-MOF was synthesized via the solvothermal method and 5wt.% Ni/Zr-MOFs were synthesized by the impregnation technique. The catalyst was characterized by various methods, including N2adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction, FE-SEM, TGA, etc. Characterization results confirmed the formation of the Zr-MOF with both microporous and mesoporous structure. The tri-reforming activity of the catalyst was evaluated in a continuous downflow tubular packed bed reactor. The effect of the reaction temperature (600-800oC) on the conversion of CO2and CH4and the synthesis gas composition was evaluated. Results dictated that pure Zr-MOF was not very active, which displayed low CH4(10.4%) and CO2(32.5%) conversion. However, at 800oC in the presence of the optimum feed (CH4: CO2: H2O: O2:N2) ratio (1: 0.5: 0.02: 0.1: 0.1), the obtained H2/CO ratio was ~1.5. The catalyst activity was significantly improved after the incorporation of nickel metal into the Zr-MOF. In the presence of 5wt.%Ni/Zr-MOFs, the obtained CO2(28.5%) and CH4(80.2%) conversion was high at 700oC. The higher activity was due to the presence of highly dispersed small-size (~) nickel particles on ZrO2derived from Zr-MOF. The nickel-metal helped to dissociate CH4, and the basic microporous ZrO2enhanced the CO2conversion. At the optimum reaction condition, the catalytic activity and the H2/CO ratio were almost constant (~1.6) for a longer period.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFormaldehyde, a critically important platform chemical, is produced from partial oxidation of methanol. The major industrial formaldehyde manufacture processes, silver catalyst and formox, face drawbacks like catalyst deactivation and operational safety hazards. Chemical looping (CL) is a reaction scheme that splits a redox reaction into two sub-reactions, facilitated by a solid reaction intermediate called the oxygen carrier (OC). It enables the spatio-temporal separation of the reaction's reduction and oxidation segments and can produce chemicals like formaldehyde via the selective partial oxidation route. During reduction, the OC donates its lattice oxygen to methanol, generating formaldehyde and steam. The reduced OC subsequently replenishes its lattice oxygen by reacting with air during oxidation. The CL scheme provides an additional degree of freedom for product optimization and avoids direct contact of air and methanol, rendering a safer operation. To ensure a high product yield and stable long-term performance of a CL system, the optimal design of its OC is crucial.This work demonstrates a novel CL route for the partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. Vanadium Phosphorous Oxide (VPO), a known catalyst capable of C-H bond activation in low-carbon alkanes, is employed as the OC. The prepared β-VPO5is dispersed on silica support (VPO-Si), enabling high active site dispersion. VPO-Si OC exhibited stable redox performance over 10 redox cycles. The results were supported by several solid characterization techniques including Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with Electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fixed-bed studies to validate the process at larger operational scale, displayed high methanol conversion of ~85% with an exceptional formaldehyde selectivity of ~45%. Density functional theory simulations are performed to elucidate the reaction pathway and the role of surface oxygen vacancies. This study facilitates the development of safer and more robust industrial formaldehyde production.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAmong the most critical areas of research and development is that of efficient energy conversion. Despite this, the transportation industry remains poised to continue reliance on fossil fuels in the coming years. This necessitates continued efforts in the study of clean, economical, hydrocarbon fuel synthesis.Of the proposed solutions, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is particularly attractive. Despite being a well-known approach to synthetic fuel,it has been hindered by economies of scale leaving the process with no current means of environmentally and economically friendly, large-scale application. The limiting factor arises in production of syngas which traditionally utilizes energy intensive steam reforming.One approach to resolving this issue is in combining the FTS and reforming steps into a single, intensified reactor system utilizing two catalysts and operating under moderate pressure and temperature conditions. To better understand this system and guide experimental efforts, a multiscale model incorporating kinetics, and mass/heat transfer has been developed. The model utilizes kinetics adapted from literature including the Xu and Froment kinetics of steam reforming and an ASF approach to modeling FTS for an iron catalyst. The kinetics were fit using experimental data from our group and the mass and heat transfer verified using literature data. Using this model, we screened feed compositions, operating conditions and catalyst bed configurations to observe their impact on the hydrocarbon product.Due to thermodynamic limitations, the reforming and FTS sections must be maintained at separate temperatures. Leveraging the endothermic and exothermic reactions and an analysis of proposed heat exchanger designs, the model provided insights on areas on which experimental efforts would be best focused. Properly applied, multiscale models such as this provide essential qualitative information on experimentally complex systems. This accelerates understanding and advancement toward essential goals such as economical, cleaner energy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract1,3-butadiene, the main petrochemical for rubber production, can be produced from biomass ethanol rather than fossil feedstocks. Although ethanol-to-1,3-butadiene (ETB) reaction can occur in a single step in the Lebedev process, adding acetaldehyde to the feed can significantly improve the selectivity to 1,3-butadiene at a lower temperature, as a result, the Ostromislensky process can be more effective for 1,3-butadiene production. Our results show that the first step of ethanol-to-acetaldehyde over Cu can be lowered to 215 ˚C with induction heating (IH), and the second step of ethanol and acetaldehyde-to-1,3-butadiene is preferred above 300 ˚C. Having each step perform at its preferred temperature can reduce energy consumption, produce fewer side products, and improve the selectivity to 1,3-butadiene. This can be achieved by applying IH to a tandem system, through which the heat is provided by the hysteresis loss from the susceptors and can be controlled to create two temperature zones in one reactor.Our results of the tandem system show that the selectivity to C4 products, including 1,3-butadiene and butene isomers, are improved compared with the single bed system with the pure ethanol feed. While the selectivities to 1,3-butadiene and butene isomers over 4wt% ZrO2/SiO2 catalyst with IH are 1.88% and 1.97%, respectively, the tandem system can achieve 1,3-butadiene and butene isomers selectivities of 29.2% and 14.5%, respectively, showing its potential to improve the selectivity to C4 products by providing acetaldehyde and H2 to the second catalyst bed and controlling the temperatures separately for each reaction step. Adjusting the temperature and the space velocity can further improve selectivity. Applying induction heating to the ETB tandem reaction can control reaction temperatures individually for the first time, a breakthrough technology for reducing carbon footprint and increasing product efficiency.",

Akin to selective (S ~ 90%) ethylene epoxidation on promoted Ag/α-Al2O3formulations, epoxidation of propylene in the presence of alkyl chloride gas phase promoters features concurrent propagation of two catalytic sequences: unselective/selective oxidation of propylene as well as deposition/removal of selectivity-enhancing surface chlorine (Cl*). Distinctive in propylene epoxidation, however, is the direct participation of propylene in Cl* removal to rapidly generate gaseous allyl chloride, reducing steady-state promoting Cl* coverages. Discussed results show the key role of decomposition of allyl chloride—generated in-situ from C2H5Cl or co-fed directly—in maintaining appreciable Cl* coverages for selective propylene epoxidation. Additionally, results varying partial pressures of co-fed gaseous promoters (such as NO and CO2) highlight the roles of well-known promoters in accrual of surface-bound Cl*, and therefore provide new insights into relationships between process conditions and catalyst performance over promoted Ag/CaCO3.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe non-petroleum production of aromatic compounds (BTX) using shale gas has emerged as a promising alternative to the energy-intensive naphtha reforming process. The ZSM-5 zeolite-supported molybdenum (Mo) oxide catalyst (Mo/ZSM-5) is a highly effective catalyst for the non-oxidative aromatization of shale gas to BTX. However, coke formation under high temperatures above 650°C leads to rapid catalyst deactivation. The formation of graphitic hard coke outside the catalyst particles is particularly problematic as it requires high regeneration temperatures that can sinter Mo-active sites and degrade zeolitic framework, making regenerability crucial for commercialization. In this study, a post-synthetic approach using quaternary ammonium hydroxides (QAHs) as organic bases was proposed to enhance the catalytic lifetime and regenerability of Mo/ZSM-5 by inhibiting the formation of external hard coke during shale gas aromatization. The QAH treatments were performed on ZSM-5 under hydrothermal conditions similar to those used for zeolite crystallization, resulting in the regioselective formation of an Al-depleted region near the surface of ZSM-5 zeolites. The Mo-active sites loaded via the wet-impregnation method exhibited a spatial distribution that strongly correlated with the distribution of framework Al-sites. The Mo/QAH-treated-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited exceptional shale gas dehydroaromatization performance at 700°C and superior catalytic lifetime compared to untreated Mo/ZSM-5 due to effective suppression of external hard coke formation resulting from the reduced surface active site density (Figure 1a). The QAH-treatment facilitated the formation of soft coke that could be easily removed under milder regeneration conditions, as revealed by thermogravimetric analysis. The Mo/QAH-treated-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited greater regenerability under oxidative regeneration cycles than the untreated Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts (Figure 1b), owing to the preference for soft coke formation over hard coke formation. This study not only offers a method to produce a coke-resistant catalyst under highly carbonaceous circumstances but also provides detailed insights into the mechanism underlying coke formation during shale gas utilization.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBrønsted acid (H+) sites in zeolites catalyze monomolecular alkane cracking and dehydrogenation via protolytic pathways involving carbocationic transition states. Propane dehydrogenation also occurs via H-transfer routes on product-derived carbonaceous deposits. These deposits form in H-deficient regions of catalyst beds, with their H-abstraction capacity depending on their H-saturation. Co-feeding excess H2suppresses the number and reactivity of these carbonaceous residues, enabling the measurement of protolytic dehydrogenation rates. In CHA framework, first-order propane cracking rate constants (per H+) increase with increasing six-membered ring (6-MR) H+site pairing. Previous proposals suggest that this rate increase is due to the entropic stabilization of carbocationic transition states at 6-MR paired H+sites. Herein, we explore the catalytic consequences of H+site proximity on monomolecular propane and n-butane cracking and dehydrogenation.CHA zeolites were synthesized with varying 6-MR paired H+sites by varying the compositions of structure directing agents (SDAs). First-order apparent rate constants (per H+) for propane and n-butane cracking and dehydrogenation increased linearly with 6-MR paired H+sites content. Assuming measured rates reflect contributions from independent paired and isolated site ensembles, apparent propane and n-butane activation rate constants (748 K, per H+) were estimated to be ~6–10× higher at paired sites. Estimated apparent cracking and dehydrogenation activation enthalpies were similar for both site ensembles, while activation entropies were systematically less negative at 6-MR paired H+sites (> 15 J mol-1K-1). This increase in activation entropy appears to reflect loosely bound carbocationic transition states at 6-MR paired H+sites resulting from attenuated ion-pair interaction between the carbocationic transition state and the anionic framework charge, likely via stabilization of the anionic lattice charge by the spectating H+site. Our findings further the understanding of how H+site proximity and multi-ion-pair interactions influence the chemical properties and catalytic reactivity of acid zeolites.",

Despite generally enhanced bulk performance of mesopore-modified “hierarchical” zeotypes in upgrading bulky molecules, we show that diffusivity enhancements must be contextualized with crystal sizes, microporous framework architectures of parent zeotypes, and active site distributions (or zoning). For poly-substituted aromatics alkylation on Brønsted acid zeolites (H-Al-MFI, H-Al-MOR, H-Al-BEA), kinetic control (Thiele modulus ≤ 1) dominates in hierarchical zeolites for all studied mesopore synthesis strategies (recrystallization, desilication, and/or dealumination) unless a high crystal radius (R~ 10 µm) oversaturates the Thiele modulus beyond feasibly compensatory increases in effective diffusivity. While reactivity and selectivity are highly sensitive to subtle nuances in pore structure and connectivity, deactivation and subsequent coke formation follow collapsible trends as functions of surface area, mesopore volume, and extent of reaction. These insights into reaction engineering in diffusion-limited extremes according to mesopore accessibility highlights the flexibility of zeolites in novel reaction systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNH3has attracted significant attention as a potential hydrogen carrier because of its high hydrogen density, ease of storage, and zero carbon emission. Developing efficient catalysts for NH3decomposition to N2and H2is crucial to achieve the NH3-mediated hydrogen economy. Ru-exchanged 13X zeolites exhibit extraordinarily high specific activity (≥ 3,000 h-1) for NH3decomposition at a low Ru-loading (≤ 1.4 wt.%), at which Ru is atomically dispersed1. In this work, we study the nature of the Ru-13X catalysts using computational chemistry calculations. The catalytic systems are constructed by adding one or two Ru atom(s) to the 13X structure at the experimentally identified sites. First, the N-H bond dissociation step is investigated on a single Ru center varying formal oxidation states of Ru (+1-+3). The Ru oxidation state was found to play a key role; the higher the oxidation state, the stronger the NH3binding and the lower the N-H bond activation energy. Interestingly, the Ru oxidation state dictates the N-H activation mode, which occurs either homolytically (Ru(+1)) or heterolytically (Ru(+2 or +3)), where the latter is more facile. The heterolytic dissociation resembles the functionality of Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) as Ru accepts electrons from NH2-(Lewis acid) and framework oxygen donates an electron pair to H+(Lewis base). The Ru oxidation state also influences the thermodynamic stability of Ru-13X, with Ru(+2) being the most stable. These suggest that Ru(+3) is active but unstable, whereas Ru(+2) is less active but stable. This is further confirmed by energetics of the full NH3decomposition reaction pathway (2NH3→N2+3H2) on the catalysts with two Ru centers. Our computational results are in excellent agreement with experimental observations demonstrating how experiments and theory can synergistically work towards elucidating complex ammonia decomposition chemistry. The identified unique FLP functionality can provide further guidance for designing zeolite-based single-atom catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWater is essential in various industrial processes, particularly in the production of fuel and chemicals utilizing ethanol and other bio-based feedstocks. Zeolites are porous catalysts used extensively due to their shape-selective adsorption and confinement interactions. Zeolite effectiveness is significantly impacted by the presence of water, which may reduce product selectivity and reactivity depending on the polarity of transition states. Using advanced computational techniques including ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and machine learning force fields (MLFF), we examined the stability of various water loadings in zeolite AFI with different Si-Al ratios and Al distributions. This analysis enables us to identify the water distribution in the pore, revealing the formation of water clusters in acid zeolites. This further assists in uncovering the intricate molecular details of complex solvated reactions such as ethanol to olefins for sustainable aviation fuels.Our analysis reveals that the behavior of water in zeolites is influenced by the Si/Al ratio and the distribution of Al in the framework. We find the average adsorption energy per water molecule is distinct for each Al distribution, as determined by both MD and DFT calculations. Interestingly, we observe that the relationship between the average adsorption energy and the Al distribution differs between MD and DFT, due to the kinetics involved. Further, we found that the peaks in the vibrational density of states (vDOS) of water in Al-defected AFI are shifted, particularly at the saturation water loading. Our radial distribution function (RDF) analysis and heat maps reveal that, with increasing water loading, water molecules tend to distribute evenly throughout the entire pore in zeolite AFI. Our results provide crucial insights into the molecular-level behavior of water in zeolites which we are now applying to understand ethanol to olefins kinetics when water is present.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydride transfers and β-scission are key elementary reactions prevalent in solid-acid-catalyzed hydrocarbon transformations. Bimolecular in nature, they feature relatively bulky transition states (TS) and different zeolites are known to display significantly different reactivities towards these reactions due to the intricate interactions between the transition-state complexes and the unique active-site environment in each zeolite. These features, however, make it a challenging task to model them in a consistent and predictive manner. To address this challenge, we have recently developed a method that uses force field-based sampling to generate quasi-TS complexes, followed by semi-automated TS refinement based on ab-initio density-functional theory (DFT) calculations.1The method was demonstrated on the protolytic cracking of n-butane inside the TON, MFI, LTA, and FAU zeolites. Here, we present a comprehensive study of hydride transfer and β-scission reactions across different active sites in these four zeolites, for linear and branched reactants containing 4–6 carbon atoms. Compared to monomolecular TS in protolytic cracking, substantial variations were observed for the bimolecular mechanisms, with values ranging from 0–95 kJ/mol for β-scission and 0–37 kJ/mol for hydride transfers. Further considering the reactant-state energies, ensemble-averaged intrinsic barriers can be computed, which are found to be dominated by a few sites with the lowest TS energies.Malviya, S. & Bai, P.

    "abstract": "AbstractAromatic alkylation with light alkene on acidic zeolites provides important pathways to produce ethylbenzene, cumene, and ethyltoluene products. This work provides mechanistic details of toluene (C7H8) alkylation with ethylene (C2H4) on acidic mordenite by combining kinetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical methods. All protons in a small eight-membered ring (8-MR) are selectively exchanged with Na+, allowing the kinetic inquiry on protons solely in 12-MR environments. Alkylation products were the only products detected, whereas C2H4dimerization/oligomerization products were not detected at all conditions tested. Alkylation rates remained independent of C7H8pressure but increased linearly with C2H4pressure, suggesting π-bonded C7H8as the most abundant surface intermediates. Such a conclusion is consistent with a larger adsorption equilibrium constant for C7H8than for C2H4from infrared and theoretical results. Dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) results show that favorable van der Waals interactions between π-bonded C7H8and the micropore are responsible for its favorable formation compared to ethoxide from C2H4. This π-bonded C7H8reacts with co-adsorbed C2H4in a concerted manner to form ethyltoluene (C9H12) products. DFT-derived kinetically relevant transition state involves a concurrent transfer of H+to the C2H4moiety and the C-C formation with C7H8. The preferential formation of o- and p-C9H12is expected due to inductive and resonance effects. Yet, measured isomer selectivity between o-, m-, and p-C9H12reached 3:1:1 even at near-zero conversion (< 0.05%), indicating the formation of all isomers as primary products. Such selectivity is consistent with DFT predictions. The extent of H+transfer to C2H4at the C-C coupling transition state is greater in forming m-C9H12than o-C9H12, making it a better electrophile and thus compensating for less nucleophilic nature at the m-position. These results provide molecular-level pictures of the alkylation process occurring within confined spaces that have remained unclear and even debatable in the literature.",

    "abstract": "AbstractZeolite-catalyzed toluene methylation by dimethyl ether (DME) is a desirable route to producep-xylene, a key plastics precursor. Zeolites are mesoporous aluminosilicates synthesized using structure directing agents (SDA) that contain a diversity of Brønsted acid sites associated with distinct Al locations and arrangements. MFI zeolites are traditionally synthesized using tetra-n-propylammonium (TPA+), and kinetic measurements during toluene methylation in these zeolites (4 kPa toluene, 66 kPa DME, 403 K at <1% conversion) result in lowp-xylene selectivity (22–30%) witho-xylene being the major product (64–66% selectivity). However, when using unconventional SDAs such as ethylenediamine (EDA) and 1,4-diazabycyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), the measuredp-xylene selectivity was consistently above 70%, suggesting that SDAs used during synthesis impact xylene isomer selectivity during toluene methylation reactions. Here, we use density functional theory to explore the role of Al location on xylene formation transition states and assess the relative stability of Al near SDAs across all MFI 12 unique T-sites to rationalize experimentally measured selectivities. At T12, toluene methylation barriers are 125, 135, and 131 kJ mol−1foro-,m-, andp-xylene formation respectively, suggesting a slight preference towardso-xylene. At T4, an Al location far from channel intersections, barriers suggest a stronger preference towardp-xylene, with barriers foro- andm-xylene being 24 and 5 kJ mol−1higher. This is consistent with the experimentally measured selectivities, suggesting that SDA of choice during synthesis biases aluminum location and thus influences xylene selectivity. To test this hypothesis, we also show that DABCO results in a more equitable T-site distribution than TPA+, thus increasing Al populations in more-confined locations such as T4. These experimental and theoretical data indicate that tuning Al siting in MFI leads can be used to increasep-xylene selectivity. This was further explored by extending toluene methylation reactions to TON, BEA, and MCM41 (unconfined) catalysts.",

We focus on the use of feeds derived from lactic acid, a product sustainably fermented from a range of bio-derived sugar sources.Utilizing an inert and site-selective chemical titrant to form an inorganic / organic composite can provide desirable selectivity tuning. Here, a selectivity enhancement from 60 to upwards of 96 C% was demonstrated for methyl lactate dehydration to methyl acrylate and acrylic acid over a composite Na-FAU based zeolite catalyst using amines as titrants to suppress side reactions on in situ-generated Brønsted acid sites (BASs).1,2We evaluate the eﬀectiveness of BAS titration by considering basicity and steric properties of the titrant molecule to maximize selectivity enhancement. Several different amine titrants outperform the previously studied pyridine.31,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (12BPE) and 4,4-trimethylenedipyridine (44TMDP), at a nominal loading of two molecules per Na-FAU supercage, afforded a dehydration selectivity of 96±3% over 2000 min time on stream, exceeding the commercial viability target for selectivity of 90%. Tuning the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) from 0.9 to 0.2 h-1 afforded a yield as high as 92% at a selectivity of 96% with 44TMDP impregnated Na-FAU, resulting in the highest yield reported to date.

    "abstract": "AbstractAmmonia produced through green hydrogen is considered a promising energy carrier for the future. Ammonia synthesis is a structure-sensitive reaction and the dynamic evolution of catalyst surfaces induced by reaction atmosphere leads to significant differences between the ideal surface and the realistic surface during the reaction process. Identifying the realistic surface is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms. In this work, we focus on the formation of stable surfaces for Co3Mo3N catalyst in different scenarios under the atmosphere of nitrogen and hydrogen. Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that Co3Mo3N catalyst can adjust surface states in response to various conditions. Both nitrogen and hydrogen possess two types of sites with distinct coordination environments. Based on ab initio thermodynamics phase diagram, metal-hydrogenated surfaces and subsurface defects are more likely to form under realistic gas-phase environments of nitrogen and hydrogen. There is no competitive adsorption behavior between nitrogen and hydrogen. Clean surfaces are thermodynamically less stable than hydrogenated surfaces under a wide range of reaction and activation conditions, which has been also confirmed by a series of temperature-programmed desorption experiments. The evolution of the surface has a significant impact on the electronic structure and reaction performance of Co3Mo3N catalyst. The presence of surface H species inhibits the nitrogen dissociation process, but has no effect on the lattice nitrogen hydrogenation process. This insight on the realistic surface is crucial for understanding of reaction mechanism and designing of high-performance catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAmmonia production is highly centralized, but recent efforts to produce ammonia at a mass manufactured modular scale faces unique scaling challenges. One approach to modular manufacturing uses membranes with integrated catalysts, such as 2D zeolites, to separate product ammonia streams leading to process intensification. To match membrane conditions, we must design highly active catalysts that can operate under mild conditions (e.g. 300 C, 10 bar). Transition metal nanoparticles supported on metal nitrides (TM-MN) have been shown to enable synergistic mechanisms for ammonia synthesis where nitrogen adsorbs at nitrogen vacancies and is sequentially hydrogenated. This so-called associative mechanism avoids the nitrogen dissociation step and allows for catalytic reactivity at lower temperatures. There are many possible binary and ternary metal nitrides, and here we use a synergistic combination of Density Functional Theory (DFT), microkinetic modeling, and machine learning regression and classification to identify the mechanism and reaction rates for different classes of metal nitrides and screen new hypothetical nitrides. In addition to metal nitrides, we also consider single atom sites directly incorporated into the zeolite membrane for ammonia production.We have generated a set of binary and ternary transition metal nitrides that significantly differ in their nitrogen formation energy and hydrogenation barriers. This includes nitride perovskites (ABN3). Recent literature has developed descriptors for predicting transition metal oxide reactivity including thed-band width, electron affinity, as well as centers of the O2pband that we are adapting to metal nitrides to predict kinetic barriers for ammonia production. Using these approaches, we are screening metal nitrides to develop data-driven descriptor-based models to predict hydrogenation barriers and vacancy formation energies. On a subset of the most kinetically interesting nitrides, we use microkinetic modeling based on the obtained DFT energies to determine turnover rates at relevant process temperatures.",

    "abstract": "AbstractApplication of membrane for CO2capture from flue gas has been limited by the trade-off between CO2permeance and CO2/N2selectivity for most polymeric membrane materials. To overcome this limitation, we have studied the facilitated transport membrane (FTM) possessing both high permeance and selectivity and designed a membrane process that can capitalize on high-selectivity offered by FTM. We have elucidated the carrier saturation phenomenon, characteristic of FTMs, using a new FTM containing the aminoacid salt of 2-(1-piperazinyl)ethylamine sarcosinate as mobile carrier and polyvinylamine as fixed-site carrier. The membrane was used to fabricate 1.4-m2spiral-wound modules, which exhibited a CO2permeance of 1450 GPU and a CO2/N2selectivity of 185 at 67°C with actual coal-derived flue gas at the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) in Wilsonville, AL, USA. Furthermore, a significant increase in CO2permeance has been achieved upon the bulk removal of CO2for the range of CO2partial pressures relevant to carbon capture from coal flue gas. For instance, the CO2permeance increased from 1464 to 1918 GPU when the CO2partial pressure reduced from 74.1 to 3.9 kPa at 67°C. Such a carrier saturation phenomenon has been modeled and incorporated into a novel 2-stage membrane process featuring partial retentate recycle. As the bulk CO2removal reduces the CO2partial pressure gradually in the membrane module, this feature mitigates the carrier saturation and results in an uprising CO2permeance upon the CO2removal. In addition, an integrated skid of the 2-stage membrane process was tested at the NCCC with an actual natural gas flue gas, demonstrating 90 – 99% CO2capture degrees, all with ≥95% purity (on dry basis), during the parametric testing and at steady state for 500 h cumulatively with 91.0% CO2capture and >95% CO2purity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFunctional mesoporous materials are a class of porous solids with pore size of 2-50 nm. They not only possess unique properties such as a high specific surface area, a large pore size and volume, and pore uniformity control, but also have excellent optical, electrical and magnetic properties of inorganic functional nanoparticles. Therefore, multilevel functional mesoporous materials have broad application prospects in many fields such as catalysis, adsorption, separation and biomedicine. In this paper, we mainly review the recent advances in the synthesis of multilevel functional mesoporous materials by oriented assembly controlled by interfacial assembly of surfactant monomicelles. Based on the core idea of interface assembly regulation, we developed a series of new methods for the synthesis of multilevel structural and functional mesoporous materials, includingconfinedmicro-emulsion confinement self-assembly, liquid-liquid bi-phase synthesis,evaporation-driven oriented/aggregation assembly, anisotropic growth method,interface driven orientation arrangement, interfacial dynamic migration strategyetc.By using these new synthesis approaches, a family of novelmesoporous nanomaterials with one-level and multi-level architectures can benationally designed andwell synthesized, such as core-shell, yolk-shell, multi-shell, 2D film structures for silica, TiO2, carbon spheres, 3D mesoporous bouquet-posy-like TiO2multi-level superstructures and asymmetric Janus, single-hole hollow structure, nano-thermometer, multipods nanostructure, hemispheres, streamlined nanotadpolesetc.. These novel mesoporous materials not only have unique and uniform morphology, but also have controllable mesoscopic pore structure, high specific surface area, large pore volume and open pore. It is because of their unique structure and function that these materials show a very good application prospect in biomedicine and other fields.",

Of various proposed PGM-free catalysts, the atomically dispersed transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) materials have been found to be especially promising for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as potential replacement for Pt-based cathode catalysts in low-temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). More recently, these catalysts have shown respectable activity for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR). PGM-free catalysts have also been developed for low-temperature water electrolyzers (LTWEs) operating with anion exchange membranes. Examples of catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction for the LTWE anode include Ni alloys (typically involving another transition metal) and a variety of oxides, e.g., perovskites. Ni alloys are also commonly used as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts at the LTWE cathode.In this presentation, we will review recent progress in the development of PGM-free catalysts for several electrochemical reactions of high importance to energy conversion: ORR in PEFCs, OER and HER catalysts in LTWEs utilizing anion exchange membranes, and CO2RR in electrolyzers designed for the conversion of CO2to various value-added products.

    "abstract": "AbstractChemical synthesis is responsible for significant emissions of carbon dioxide worldwide. These emissions arise not only due to the energy requirements of chemical synthesis, but since hydrocarbon feedstocks can be overoxidized or used as hydrogen sources. Using renewable electricity to drive chemical synthesis may provide a route to overcoming these challenges, enabling synthetic routes which operate at benign conditions and utilize sustainable inputs. We are developing an electrosynthetic toolkit in which distributed feedstocks, including carbon dioxide, dinitrogen, water, and renewable electricity, can be converted into diverse fuels, chemicals, and materials.In this presentation, we will first share recent advances made in our laboratory on nitrogen fixation to synthesize ammonia at ambient conditions. Specifically, our lab has investigated a continuous lithium-mediated approach to ammonia synthesis and understood the reaction network that controls selectivity. We have developed non-aqueous gas-diffusion electrodes which lead to high rates of ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions and imaged the reactive solid-electrolyte interphase with atomic precision. Then, we will discuss how water can be used as a sustainable oxygen-atom source and how carbon dioxide can be used to achieve carbon chain extension. These findings will be discussed in the context of a broader range of electrosynthetic transformations which could lead to local and on-demand production of critical chemicals and materials.",

However, the development of PGM-free catalysts for anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) has lagged behind, presumably owing to its sluggish kinetics in alkali. Since Raney nickel (Ni) was explored for alkaline HOR catalysis in 1960s, research on Ni-based HOR catalysts has begun and now is flourishing, majorly thanks to their favorable adsorption energies of key HOR intermediates (e.g., Ni-Hadand Ni-OHad). At present, a number of strategies have been developed to improve HOR performances of Ni-based materials, such as alloying, Ni nitridation, and alloy amorphization, which yield cost-effective HOR catalysts that rival, or even exceed, the activity and stability of PGM counterparts.In this talk, I will describe our recent research endeavors toward the development of efficient Ni-based HOR catalysts for practical HEMFC anodes. First, we briefly highlight the important merits of HEMFC technology and why Ni-based materials are appealing for alkaline HOR catalysis. Critical innovations in the design of Ni-based nanostructured and bulky catalysts were then discussed, showing their great promise to catalyze alkaline HOR that traditionally relied on PGMs. To demonstrate utility, performances of the elaborately designed Ni-based catalysts under realistic fuel-cell conditions were examined, along with an initial effort to develop CO-tolerant HEMFC anode. I will conclude this talk by outlining future research directions that allow access to next-generation PGM-free HOR catalysts for advanced HEMFCs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical processes are poised to play a pivotal role in the evolving global power system as the efficient interconversion of electrical and chemical energy can enable the deployment of sustainable technologies that support the decarbonization of the electric grid, power the automotive fleet, and offer new opportunities for chemical manufacturing. However, this transition requires new electrochemical technologies with performance, cost, and scalability metrics that align with emerging needs, inspiring innovative approaches that leverage unconventional materials and/or reactor designs. Redox-mediated electrode processes, where a soluble redox couple (the mediator) shuttles electrons to / from an \"off-electrode\" material, are of emerging interest as they may expand the portfolio of feasible reactants, system configurations, and operating modes. Prior literature has taught how this approach can enhance the charge-storage capacity of redox flow batteries, facilitate difficult-to-perform electrochemical transformations, and unlock spatial and temporal flexibility in electrochemical processes. While promising, the performance of these systems is governed by coupled reactive-transport processes which present complex (and transient) interdependencies that frustrate navigation through the multi-dimensional design space.Here, we will present a mathematical modeling framework that uses traditional chemical engineering principles to describe redox-mediated electrochemical processes. Simulated electrochemical and fluid dynamic performances will be validated against experimental observations reported in the literature. Subsequently, dimensionless groups will be derived that enable the generalization of model findings (e.g., scaling relationship and property tradeoffs) and the articulation of design criteria for existing and conceptual electrochemical energy systems.AcknowledgementsThis work was funded by the Skoltech – MIT Next Generation Program.

    "abstract": "AbstractEvery year, billions of tires are sent to scrap yards worldwide, where they are either landfilled, milled to smaller particles, or used as fuel for rotary kilns. The tire antioxidant and antiozonant, N-(1,3-dimethyl butyl)-N'-phenyl-1,4-benzenediamine (6PPD) was recently shown to cause acute mortality in aquatic life in the ng/L concentration range. Thus, current end-of-life (EOL) tire management strategies are dangerous for the environment, and different valorization strategies are needed. A critical step in the overall valorization strategy is the removal of 6PPD from EOL tires to ensure it does not leach into the environment. Additionally, legislation will soon outlaw the incorporation of 6PPD in new tires. Future valorization will be needed to be powered by renewable energy to meet decarbonization goals. Microwave (MW) assisted heating is an attractive technology for this application as the carbon black inherent to EOL tires is an excellent microwave energy absorber and can enable fast heating. We investigate solvent-based extraction of 6PPD from waste tires, its subsequent conversion into value-added products, and the pyrolysis of crumb rubber, all under MW-assisted heating.The solvent screening was first carried out in batch mode under MW heating to determine which solvent is most efficient at extracting 6PPD from waste tires. The MW extraction was subsequently scaled up to a continuous flow system where high volumes of crumb rubber could be extracted. Temperature measurements were carried out down the length of the reactor and on the reactor wall at various power levels in a static bed and under gas and solvent flow. Temperature models were derived to relate power level to the temperature within the rubber phase.After extraction, 6PPD and the extracted crumb rubber were subsequently upgraded. 6PPD was catalytically converted into cyclohexane. The condensed product mixture from the reactor effluent contained various aromatic and terpene products. The carbon black remaining in the solid phase was characterized. Our work presents strategies for the full valorization of the tires while providing mechanistic insights.",

Herein, the oxidative functionalization of plastic waste derivatives, particularly long aliphatic alkanes, using non-thermal, atmospheric plasma processing is presented as a green, catalyst-free step for plastic waste upcycling. A modular plasma microreactor utilizing Ar/O2gas mixtures was employed to functionalize n-dodecane. C12secondary alcohols and ketones emerged as the main products with high production rates due to enhanced mass transfer via microreactor assembly. Higher conversions resulted in the formation of difunctional oxygenates, oligomerized oxygenates, and lighter hydrocarbon products stemming from carbon cleavage. The residence time and plasma-liquid interface were optimized by modifying the gas and liquid flow rates to achieve competitive energy yields. A mixture of liquid n-alkanes obtained through catalytic hydrogenolysis of low-density polyethylene was tested using the plasma microreactor to confirm process applicability.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe pulp and paper industry represents 2% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions, of which the vast majority are biogenically derived. Thus, these biogenic carbon emissions represent an opportunity for carbon-negative pulp and paper processing if captured and sequestered. Despite this potential, the integration of these technologies has yet to be deeply explored in the pulp and paper industry. Recovery boilers, biomass and multi-fuel boilers, and lime kilns are the primary sources of carbon emissions in an integrated pulp mill. The most significant contributor is the recovery boiler, followed by multi-fuel boilers, with lime kilns contributing the least. However, lime kilns have an advantage from a carbon capture standpoint because they have the highest concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and are capable of handling even higher concentrations. Therefore, research on the feasibility of retrofitting or re-designing lime kilns to oxy-fuel combustion or electrification has gained significant attention over the past decade due to its generation of high-purity CO2(> 90%) and potential for low-cost CO2capture. In addition, multiple Direct Air Capture companies are developing electrified kilns for calcium carbonate (CaCO3) calcination, and thus this research is directly applicable to such endeavors. The project involves assessing the feasibility of operating pulp mill lime kilns under high CO2conditions to elucidate potential barriers to using oxy-fuel or electrified lime kiln technologies. First, a kinetic assessment for the calcination of lime mud (mainly CaCO3) from a commercial chemical pulp mill under high CO2concentrations was carried out. Both constant heating rate (FWO) and isothermal kinetic assessments were performed using TGA under idealistic conditions. Second, insight from the kinetic assessments was used to design experiments with a three-zone splittable, high-temperature, electrified rotary tube furnace under more realistic conditions. The large, rotary tube furnace was confined to operate within conditions acceptable to the pulping industry. A 1D numerical model was then developed in KilnSimu to simulate the calcination baseline (15% CO2concentration) and the high CO2scenario (90% CO2concentration) using a commercial lime kiln as a reference. To demonstrate the technology, three kilograms of lime mud were processed in the rotary kiln under a high CO2scenario (90% CO2), reaching an extent of calcination greater than 95% with 70 minutes of retention time. In a lime kiln operation, producing good quality burned lime is essential. Burned lime (CaO) quality is assessed by its residual CaCO3content, availability, and reactivity. The amount of CaO in the burned lime available for slaking represents the lime availability. Moreover, lime reactivity refers to the speed at which the CaO can be hydrated in the slaker, forming calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), which reacts with the sodium carbonate present in the green liquor to regenerate the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) needed in the pulping process. The obtained burn lime under high CO2calcination was causticized with a 12.5% sodium carbonate solution for 2.5 hours at 90 ℃, confirming the NaOH production. Then, the precipitated CaCO3was processed again in the rotary kiln under high CO2conditions to prove the reproducibility of the calcium cycle. The extent of calcination for the second round was similar to the first result, with a CaO content above 95%. This first-of-a-kind study demonstrates the technical feasibility of repetitively calcining pulp mill-derived lime mud effectively into CaO under conditions expected in commercial-scale, electrified kiln technologies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConventional thermochemical processes such as natural gas (CH4) conversion and ammonia (NH3) synthesis are often powered by fossil-fuel-based continuous heating, which are extremely carbon-heavy with severe CO2emissions. In addition, as the near-equilibrium continuous heating lacks rapid, precise and time-resolved control over the temperature profile (i.e., the reaction temperature and timescale), many reactions also suffer from poor selectivity, low yield, and/or poor catalyst stability. In this talk, I will present a novel far-from-equilibrium operating technique for thermochemical reactions (Nature 2022, 605, 470-476; Cover article) that employs programmable heating and quenching (PHQ) via electrification (i.e., Joule heating), which precisely controls the transient heating time (e.g., 20–110 ms) and provides rapid temperature quenching from up to 2400 K to near room temperature for gas phase reactants in milliseconds, resulting in improved selectivity, energy efficiency, and catalyst stability. Using CH4pyrolysis as a model reaction, our catalyst-free PHQ process enables high selectivity to value-added C2products (> 75%vs.< 35% by the conventional catalyst-free method, andvs.< 60% by most conventional methods with optimized catalysts) at a significantly lower energy cost (reduced by > 80%). Our PHQ process added a new dimension of tunability to thermochemical synthesisviathe time-resolved temperature profile, which creates a unique opportunity for us to employ active learning to rapidly optimize any target product (e.g., C2H4) with much less experimental effort compared to conventional trial and error approaches. Beyond the homogeneous and endothermic CH4pyrolysis, we further demonstrate the utility of PHQ in NH synthesis, which is heterogeneous and exothermic. Under far-from-equilibrium conditions by PHQ, we achieve a stable NH3synthesis rate of ~6000 μmol/g/h under ambient pressure for over 100 h with a non-optimized Fe catalyst, which is among the highest even when comparing to literature reports utilizing optimized catalysts. We envision the PHQ technique can potentially address some of the most pressing issues in the chemical industry by enabling process intensification and decarbonizing the chemical manufacturing process using renewable electricity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe utilization of renewable biomass as an alternative resource has received great attention to relieve the reliance on fossil fuels, which can lead to the emission of greenhouse gases causing global warming. Besides, process heating from the combustion of fossil fuels in many industrial applications is also one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Ethanol is a sustainable resource from biomass fermentation, and its non-oxidative dehydrogenation is a vital source to obtain H2 and acetaldehyde, which is a key intermediate for producing acetic acid, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and 1,3-butadiene. Supported Cu catalysts have been reported to show excellent ethanol conversion and selectivity to acetaldehyde at 280 ˚C. Since ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde is highly endothermic, a higher temperature is needed to increase the conversion efficiency. However, this can lead to uneven temperature distribution in the catalyst bed, decreasing the selectivity to acetaldehyde resulting from the undesired side products.Such problems can be solved by applying induction heating (IH). IH is proven to be an alternative heating method for chemical reactions using a varying magnetic field and is considered a sustainable heating method due to the possible direct usage of clean energy, such as wind, solar, and hydropower. Although being explored in various applications, from cancer treatment in the medical field to metallurgic manufacturing on an industrial scale, IH hasn’t been studied in the catalysis field until recently. In our work, we apply IH to ethanol-to-acetaldehyde reaction with physically mixed Co powder as the susceptor in the catalyst bed to provide heating directly to the catalyst. Our results show that ethanol conversion by IH is 1.7 times higher than that by conventional furnace heating at a temperature as low as 215 ˚C, suggesting the high production and energy efficiency of using IH. When the reaction temperature was increased to 245 ˚C with the furnace, the resulting conversion matched well with that obtained with IH at 215 ˚C, showing that IH significantly improves the energy efficiency by lowering the reaction temperature by 30 ˚C. The ethanol-to-acetaldehyde reaction by the IH and furnace heating showed comparable activation energies of 24.1 kJ/mol and 19.77 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition, reactions with IH and furnace heating show similar acetaldehyde selectivity of 80% from 215 ˚C - 245 ˚C, showing that the external magnetic field (MF) doesn’t affect the active sites on the catalyst. To study and further improve the catalyst’s activity with IH, we provided a model in COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate the temperature distribution and design the configuration of the catalyst bed. The temperature gradient along the reactor length was decreased to 1.5 K with the new design. In addition, the energy consumption was only 145 W compared to 435 W with the old design. The new configuration significantly increased the conversion, maintained the selectivity, and slowed down the deactivation by almost two times. The model provided a method to design the catalyst bed configuration and predict the energy consumption with desired product and energy efficiency.IH significantly improves the efficiency of ethanol-to-acetaldehyde reaction, with the well-mixed Co powder providing the heat directly from inside the reactor, eliminating the heat transfer difficulties, quickly responding to the local temperature drop due to the highly endothermic reaction, and maintaining the stable reaction temperature. Therefore, it has great potential in highly endothermic and exothermic reactions, reducing carbon footprint, and further applications in producing value-added chemicals.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAlternative feedstock for biofuel production based on non-edible plants and agricultural wastes should be explored to diffuse the food versus fuel conflict in the use of food crops such as corn and sugarcane for biofuel production. This is especially relevant in low- and middle-income countries where food security must be balanced with efforts at decarbonization. Utilizing plants such as bamboo that grow well on marginal lands that are not economically viable for cultivating food crops is crucial to diffusing this conflict. Unfortunately, bamboo has been studied far less as a renewable carbon source, unlike other feedstock such as corn stover and poplar. Thus, in this work, we studied bamboo endemic to West Africa (Bambusa vulgaris) as a feedstock for the production of renewable fermentable sugars. We investigated the effects of sequential pretreatment of bamboo prior to enzymatic hydrolysis as a way of maximizing the fermentable sugar yield to make it a cost-effective source of renewable carbon for the production of biofuels and bioproducts.Initially, the bamboo was pulverized using a hammer mill, ground with a coffee grinder, and sieved to a particle size range of 212 – 425 μm. Then, the bamboo particles were ball milled for 30 minutes (BM30) and 60 minutes (BM60). Bamboo was also subjected to a sequential pretreatment where delignification pretreatment was carried out before ball milling for 60 minutes (DL-BM60), or delignification pretreatment was done after the ball milling step (BM60-DL). Delignification was accomplished using sodium chlorite and acetic acid. Afterward, we carried out enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated bamboo samples using Cellic CTec2 cellulase enzymes (20 FPU/g biomass) in 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 5.0) at 50°C for 72 hours and analyzed the hydrolysates using HPLC.XRD analysis showed that ball milling pretreatment decreased the crystallinity of the bamboo (amorphization), with the BM60 pretreated samples being more amorphous. This translated to a recovery of 62% of the available carbohydrates in bamboo as fermentable sugars, primarily in the form of glucose and xylose, for BM60 versus a 40% sugar recovery for BM30 after enzymatic hydrolysis. Further analysis with solid-state13C NMR revealed that ball milling for 60 minutes resulted in a near-complete cellulose amorphization, leaving only ~ 10% in the crystalline state. In contrast, the hemicellulose and lignin fractions underwent minor (<5%) transformations during ball milling. Thus, the higher sugar yield for BM60 was attributed to increased accessible surfaces for enzyme reaction coupled with the increased cellulose amorphization, which is a key indicator of cellulose reactivity.This was followed by an evaluation of sequential pretreatment (DL-BM60 or BM60-DL) to address the two critical factors affecting the enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass – cellulose crystallinity and lignin content – to maximize the fermentable sugar yield obtainable from bamboo. We observed through HPLC analyses of the hydrolysates that up to 80 ± 5% of sugar yields is obtainable when delignification was done after ball milling (amorphization), i.e., BM60-DL, with the sugar yields increasing to 97 ± 4 % when a reversed order of sequential pretreatment (DL-BM60) is implemented. Solid-state NMR analysis of delignified bamboo indicated a >95% lignin removal, resulting in a 16 percentage point increase in sugar yield (versus BM60). BM60-DL increased the sugar yield by only 2 percentage points.XRD and solid-state NMR analysis results revealed that cellulose crystallinity increased after delignification and that DL-BM60 was more amorphous than BM60-DL. This meant that ball milling after delignification pretreatment (DL-BM60) was necessary to realize the combined effects of lignin removal and cellulose amorphization to achieve near-quantitative sugar yields (97%) from bamboo.Finally, techno-economic analysis for bamboo conversion was done using a model developed by NREL for corn stover conversion to sugars as a starting point. The scale of the biorefinery was adjusted for handling a circular area with a 15 km radius centered on the refinery, with all other parameters held constant from their set points. The pretreatment used for corn stover analysis was substituted with the sequential pretreatment processes for bamboo. The scale was re-adjusted to account for differences in productivity between bamboo and corn stover. All other parameters were held at their fixed point to allow a direct comparison. Costs and labor were based on the U.S. market. The projected net present value (NPV) of the bamboo biorefinery was positive ($190 MM, U.S.), whereas that of a corn stover biorefinery was negative NPV (-$430 MM, U.S.) as a result of the higher growth rate of bamboo and the effectiveness of the sequential pretreatment.In conclusion, this study revealed that ball milling bamboo for 60 minutes results in near complete amorphization of cellulose and increases the accessible surface for enzyme reactivity but does not achieve quantitative sugar yields after enzymatic hydrolysis, with almost 40% of unrecovered sugars left in bamboo. Therefore, sequential ball milling (amorphization) and delignification (lignin removal) is necessary to increase the sugar yields substantially, but the order of sequential pretreatment is crucial for maximizing the sugar yield. There is a clear preference for delignification followed by amorphization, i.e., DL-BM60, which should be factored into any technological deployment. Techno-economic analysis for bamboo conversion to sugars indicated that a bamboo biorefinery based on the preferred sequential pretreatment (DL-BM60) was economically viable with a projected positive NPV. These findings support further investment in bamboo cultivation in marginal lands and conversion to fermentable sugars as a renewable carbon source to decarbonize transportation fuels and chemical production without competing with food, especially in low- and middle-income countries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this study, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA)-based three-component deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were used to pretreat transgenic sorghum bagasse with lignin rich in DHBA. DESs were formed with choline chloride (ChCl), DHBA, and a third component (water, ethanol, ethylene glycol, respectively). Without the addition of the third component, ChCl and DHBA formed DESs at molar ratios of 2:1 and 3:2. DESs formed with both molar ratios were evaluated for delignification and xylan removal of sorghum bagasse, and ChCl-DHBA formed at 3:2 resulted in better pretreatment performance. Recently, an increasing number of studies have reported the utilization of three-component DESs in biomass pretreatment. However, studies on three-component lignin-derived phenolic compound-based DESs are limited. To further increase the pretreatment performance, three-component DESs were synthesized based on ChCl-DHBA 3:2 DES and applied to pretreat both wild-type and transgenic sorghum bagasse. Chemical compositions, cellulose properties, and enzymatic digestibility of various sorghum bagasse samples before and after pretreatment were characterized. Cellulolytic enzyme lignin and fractionated lignin were isolated and structurally characterized to provide a comprehensive investigation of three-component DHBA-based DES. The results of this study will aid in the development of a sustainable biorefinery process using lignin-based DESs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractModern technological progress, global climate concerns and the exhaustion of fossil-based feedstocks for energy and chemicals have driven the demand for viable alternatives to produce energy, chemical and materials. Thus, the development of efficient conversion technologies for second-generation biofuels has received greater interest from modern society to meet the upsurge in energy demand with bioeconomic developments. In view of this, newly developed energy crops, i.e., miscanthus, oilcane, and energy cane have been genetically engineered to simultaneously accumulate vegetative lipids and carbohydrates in their plant tissues [1, 2], thus can be considered as an alternative feedstock to cater for the enhanced biofuel yield by providing lipids along with cellulosic sugars for largescale biodiesel and bioethanol production [3-5]. However, the polymeric carbohydrate sugars are trapped in a recalcitrant lignin-carbohydrate matrix, which limits the efficient recovery of these components from transgenic crops for their downstream processing [6]. Therefore, the employment of an efficient pretreatment step is highly recommended to overcome the natural recalcitrant to facilitate the carbohydrate fractionation and their transformation into value-added chemicals, energy, and materials [7]. However, the conventional pretreatment methods involve the use of organic solvents, corrosive acids, and alkalis, which can be harmful to the environment and undermine the advocacy of a sustainable and circular economy. Besides, high energy, chemical input, production cost, inhibitor formation, low saccharification and fermentation yield are major key barriers to the development of efficient commercial biorefinery [7]. Thus, there is an immense need to develop and highly efficient fractionation of lipids and carbohydrates sugars for further processing into fuels and chemicals.In view of this, hydrothermal and natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) pretreatment potential were assessed for the deconstruction of genetically engineered bioenergy crops for their feasibility for high sugar and lipid recovery. Hydrothermal pretreatment is one of the mildest methods, which uses hot water at a relatively low temperature (up to 230 °C) and low pressure [8]. Hydrothermal pretreatment selectivity hydrolyses the hemicellulose fraction to xylose, arabinose and glucose and simultaneously generates a certain amount of degraded products such as furfural, HMF, formic acid etc., which can limit the enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass [9]. On contrary, NADES is a combination of hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), with exceptional solvent characteristics, an alternative to conventional organic solvents and benefits with easy preparation, low toxicity, high biodegradability, and high fractionation efficiency. NADES can act as adjuvants for weakening the lignin-carbohydrate recalcitrance matrix at the desired temperature of 100 to 160 °C and pretreatment circumstances while enhancing lignin solubilization and could attribute to enhanced digestibility of pretreated biomass towards cellulases.Thus, several choline chloride-based NADES were prepared using bio-derived precursors, i.e., lactic acid by varying the molar ratio of HBD and HBA (1:1, 1:2) at 60 to 80 °C and were employed for the pretreatment of transgenic oilcane bagasse, and miscanthus for the fractionation of lipids and carbohydrates. A comparative study between hydrothermal pretreatment and NADES-assessed pretreatment was conducted in terms of compositional analysis, toxins generation, chemical input, severity effect, lignin removal and overall sugar and lipid recovery from pretreated oilcane, and miscanthus biomass. The initial study showed that the suitable eutectic combination of NADES, i.e., choline chloride and lactic acid in a 1:2 molar ratio, prepared at 60-80 °C, could effectively solubilize >75% lignin, while enabling high biomass digestibility (>85%) during enzymatic saccharification, and enhance lipid recovery (>60%). In a separate experiment, hydrothermal pretreatment optimization was investigated with varying pretreatment temperatures (170-210 °C), with a residence time of 10-20 min and was compared with NADES pretreatment in terms of toxins release, glucan/ xylan recovery, lignin solubilization, crystallinity reduction, enzymatic accessibility, lipid recovery etc. Hydrothermal pretreatment of oilcane bagasse followed by enzymatic saccharification resulted in a 2-fold increase in total lipids with improved enzymatic digestibility of >75%. These findings lead to an economical an environmentally friendly method to process genetically engineered crops for selective fractionation of lipids and sugars, and would aid in developing a sustainable biorefinery platform for the co-production of biodiesel and bioethanol.Keywords:Natural deep eutectic solvents; hydrothermal pretreatment, transgenic crop, lipids, sugar, extractionReferences:Parajuli, S., et al.,Towards oilcane: Engineering hyperaccumulation of triacylglycerol into sugarcane stems.GCB Bioenergy, 2020.12(7): p. 476-490.Kumar, D., et al.,Techno-economic feasibility analysis of engineered energycane-based biorefinery co-producing biodiesel and ethanol.GCB Bioenergy, 2021.13(9): p. 1498-1514.Jia, Y., S.

    "abstract": "AbstractLignin is the second most abundant biopolymers in nature. The lignin content in softwoods is about 15 to 30wt% and 20 wt% in hardwoods. The lignin is currently underutilized because of a high heterogeneity in its structure. To utilize the great potential of this material fully, there is a need to develop an effective method that is economically and environmentally sustainable for producing lignin fractions with a more homogenous structure. In this work deep eutectic solvent systems with a lower viscosity will be developed, and its effectiveness in fractionating lignin will be studied. These novel deep eutectic solvents are characterized by measuring their melting point depression and the activity coefficients of each component in the system. Also, these solvents are further be characterized using the FT-IR technique. To understand the relationship between the solvent polarity of deep eutectic solvent systems and the chemical structure of the resulting lignin fractions, the collected lignin fractions and both the organosolv/native lignin are characterized using the NMR technique. The initial results indicated that both Organosolv and native lignin can be fractionated using the deep eutectic solvents with a low viscosity in two or more fractionation process steps. The solvent polarity of deep eutectic solvent is found to affect the physical properties of produced lignin fractions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFor sustainability in biomass conversion, it is highly recommended to adopt pretreatment methods that do not threaten the environment. Natural deep eutectic solvents are made from substances found in plant cells Choi et al.(2011) and are environmentally friendly. They have been studied as a chemical route for biomass pretreatment because of their high solubilisation power and tunability (Abbott et al., 2011). These solvents are also easily produced by combining hydrogen bond donors and bond acceptors commonly found in plants in specific molar ratios.This study applied a natural deep eutectic solvent that combined lactic acid and proline to fractionate cowpea shells. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)is one of the major sources of plant protein and generates a lot of waste from the deshelling process. According to FAO (2021), 8.9 million tonnes of cowpea were produced globally in 2020, of which Africa accounts for 97 %. Nigeria and the Republic of the Niger as the highest producers: 42 % and 31 %, respectively. A study by Jekayinfa et al. (2020) estimated that tonnes of cowpea shells are generated yearly in Nigeria and can serve as feedstock for biorefineries.Factors such as temperature, time, and water dilution have been established as some of the factors that affect the use of NADES in biorefinery (New et al., 2019). The addition of water to solvents is done for several reasons, including reducing viscosity (Dai, Witkamp, Verpoorte, & Choi, 2015), to inhibit the solubility of cellulose. (Swatloski, Spear, Holbrey, & Rogers, 2002) and to reduce the volume of solvent used in a process (New et al., 2019).However, discrepancies in the research findings of different authors(Kumar, Parikh, & Pravakar, 2016; Li, Hou, Lin, Zhang, & Fu, 2018) on the effect of these factors necessitate this study.Therefore, this work aims to apply NADES as a solvent for fractionating cowpea shells. The main objectives are to analyse the interactions between factors and to determine the optimal operating conditions using a central composite design of the response surface methodology. To the best of the authors knowledge, the effect of the interaction between temperature, time and water dilution on the fractionation of cowpea shells has not been explored. This study will provide more insight into applying NADES to pretreat cowpea shells.Materials and MethodsThe cowpea shells (Vigna unguiculatashells)were obtained from farms in Tunga in Chanchaga Local Government Area, Minna, Niger State, Nigeria and preserved in sample bags. Lactic acid (90 %) was purchased from Thermo Scientific (USA). Proline (99 %), Sulphuric acid (98 %), D- (+)-glucose and D- (+) -xylose were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Company Ltd, Germany.The substrate was washed with deionised water and sundried for two days before milling with a Retsch PM 100 Planetary ball mill (Haan, Germany) and sieved with a 425 µm laboratory test before storage.Lactic acid and proline were combined in a molar ratio of 4: 1 (Francisco, Van Den Bruinhorst, & Kroon, 2012) using the protocol described by Dai et al. (2013). The density, conductivity, and viscosity of the prepared NADES were analysed using the Attension Sigma force tensiometer (Sigma 700, Biolin Scientific USA), Jenco instruments (Model: 3020M) and RV-Viscometer (Model: NDJ-8S; W&J Instrument Co., Ltd. China), respectively.The substrate was combined with the solvent at a 5: 100 (w/w), as determined by Kumar et al. (2016), in a capped Schott bottle and placed in a high-temperature bath circulator (Daihan Scientific, Korea). At the end of the experiment, the solid was recovered from the slurry based on the procedure reported by Procentese et al. (2015) and Li et al. (2018). The recovered solid residue was dried at 35 °C and analysed using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) method (Sluiter et al., 2011) for its carbohydrate composition (glucan and xylan) and lignin composition. The upper and lower limits for the central composite design (CCD) were chosen based on the preliminary experimental results carried out. Temperature range (130 -150) ⁰C, time (4 -6) h and percentage water dilution of solvent (1.5 – 3.5) % (w/w). The results were analysed using Design Expert software 13. All experiments were carried out in duplicates.ResultsThe viscosity, conductivity, and density of the lactic acid-Proline solvent (4:1) prepared were recorded as 638.75 ± 0.35 mPa.s, 195.5 ± 0.28 µS/cm, and 1.26 ± 0.04 g/ml, respectively. The chemical composition of the cowpea shell was determined to comprise glucan (21.32 ± 0.39 %), xylan (21.46 ± 0.29 %), acid-insoluble lignin (28.40 ± 0.01 %), acid-soluble lignin (8.63 ± 0.02 %), extractives (2.10 ± 0.14 %), moisture (5.96 ± 0.65 %), Ash (1.05 ± 0.14 %). The central composite design was applied with design Expert 13 to obtain the quadratic model equation relating independent variables to the percentage responses measured ( glucan, xylan and lignin). The statistical tests (ANOVA) were performed on the quadratic models to assess their accuracy based on the probability value (P) > 0.05, R-square (determination coefficient), adjusted R-square and predicted R-square. Percentage glucan yield in pretreated cowpea shell is significantly affected by the interactions between temperature and water dilution, time and water dilution. The interaction between temperature and water dilution significantly affects the xylan percentage composition of the pretreated sample. Lignin content percentage showed that interaction between temperature and time, temperature and water dilution, and time and water dilution were also statistically significant. These results imply that water dilution is key in lactic-proline solvent biomass pretreatment application. The process was optimised by applying the numerical method to obtain a solution satisfying the three quadratic equations by maximising glucan and xylan and minimising lignin. The optimal condition was 38.4 % glucan, 24.8 % xylan and 27.06 % total lignin at temperature: 146.4 ℃, time: 6 h and water dilution at 1.5 % w/w. The models were validated by experimenting at optimal conditions. From the experimental results obtained, % glucan: 38.48 ± 0.21, % xylan: 24.66 ± 1.46 and % total lignin: 27.27 ± 1.24 shows that the model and the experimental values are in good agreement.Understanding the effect of variation of factors on the ability of Lactic-Proline, natural deep eutectic on the fractionation of cowpea shells plays a crucial role in its industrial application. This study shows that NADES can be applied for the pretreatment of cowpea shells.ReferencesAbbott, A. P., Harris, R. C., Ryder, K. S., D'Agostino, C., Gladden, L. F., & Mantle, M. D. (2011).

    "abstract": "AbstractDihydrolevoglucosenone (Cyrene) is a biomass-derived solvent that can be produced via the catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose followed by hydrogenation. It became industrially available recently and is a promising alternative to various toxic polar aprotic solvents in materials chemistry, organic synthesis, and other research fields. To exploit the potential of this novel green solvent and achieve a sustainable biorefinery process, herein, a biomass pretreatment process using Cyrene is developed. The fractionation of both hardwood and softwood under Cyrene-based organosolv systems was investigated. Results show that Cyrene effectively removed lignin and hemicellulose from the biomass at a mild condition (120 ℃), leading to enhanced fermentable sugar yields after enzymatic hydrolysis. Lignin was recovered after pretreatment and structurally characterized to access its valorization potential and understand the interactions between Cyrene and biomass. Additionally, to better understand this novel solvent in biorefinery processes, investigation of the interactions between various components in the Cyrene-based solvent system was conducted, providing insight into future utilizations.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe development of scalable and cost-efficient biomass pretreatment methods to enhance the conversion of biomass has been a challenging problem over the past decades. The purpose of this work is to optimize the conversion of woody biomass feedstocks (walnut, almond) to fermentable sugars when subjected to a process using distillable amine-based solvents, as well as demonstrating high solvent recovery and characterizing the resulting biomass fractions. Therefore, pretreatment experiments were performed at a bench-scale using an almond and walnut mix (80/20, w/w) with butylamine, ethanolamine,ethylenediamine, triethylamine (boiling points; 78, 170, 117, and 89 °C, respectively), and amine-water mixtures at different weight ratios (10-75 wt%). The biomass-solvent ratio was maintained at a fixed value and the pretreatment was performed in a pressure tube reactor for a specified reaction time. The pretreated biomass slurry was processed in three pathways: (1) washed with water, (2) distilled (3) distilled and washed with water. Each of the fractions along with raw untreated biomass were characterized for glucan/xylan composition, CHN content, and sugar release efficacy. The glucan and xylan compositions suggested that the glucan/xylan content were improved by ~18-36 % with decreasing water percentage. Results indicate that pathway-1 showed >90 % sugar release, about 41-43 % higher than pathways-2 or 3. Elemental analysis via CHN analyzer showed that a reduction in C/N ratio follows their boiling point order after distillation. Washing of distilled biomass increases the C/N ratio by 19%, 384%, and 232% for butylamine, ethanolamine, and ethylenediamine, respectively, suggesting washing could hardly remove any butylamine as chemical bonding might be present. In addition, adding water in the amine-based solvent showed higher solid recovery, implying lower sugar release than standalone amine-based solvent. Ongoing solvent recycling experiments suggested promising recovery of these amine-based solvents after lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment.Keywords: Biomass; Pretreatment; Amine-based solvent, Enzymatic hydrolysis; Sugar;",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe current energy scenario demands extensive research to efficiently produce clean fuels such as hydrogen from renewable energy sources. Hydrogen has proved to be a clean fuel as it produces no greenhouse emissions during its combustion. Traditional hydrogen production has relied on the gasification of fossil fuels through processes such as Coal gasification, Steam Methane Reforming, Autothermal Reforming, etc. However, with the increasing demand for hydrogen and depleting fossil fuels, it is essential to shift hydrogen production towards greener processes that use renewable energy sources. Several attempts have been made to achieve this goal, but these processes have reported lower efficiencies and higher production costs. However, a chemical looping process involving biomass gasification is an excellent alternative for hydrogen production, where the biomass is converted to syngas that can be integrated with the conventionally established pathways to produce molecular hydrogen.This study aims to produce hydrogen through a chemical looping process that utilizes Calcium Ferrite as an oxygen carrier (OC). The proposed process has a moving bed reactor wherein the biomass and the OC particles are fed co-currently to selectively produce partial oxidation products.Calcium Ferrite is a redox material with potentially no adverse effects on the environment, making it an attractive alternative for use in chemical looping technology. Due to its fast ionic oxygen transport mechanism, Calcium Ferrite has shown high activity owing to its brownmillerite structure. The thermodynamic properties of calcium ferrite aid in the controlled oxidation of biomass. This favors the production of partial oxidation products of biomass, i.e., Syngas, while the calcium ferrite material itself undergoes reduction to lower oxidation states. Another peculiar advantage of calcium ferrite is its ability to completely regenerate in CO2or steam, eliminating the air oxidation step required in conventional chemical looping systems and thus reducing the associated costs. The regeneration step produces carbon monoxide or hydrogen based on the regeneration media, which can be further utilized to tailor the syngas produced.In this system, the biomass and OC particles are fed from the top of the reactor, wherein they flow co-currently downwards. The top portion of the moving bed reactor contains oxidized oxygen carrier particles that react with the freshly added biomass. These particles get reduced on progressing further down through the reactor as they continuously react with biomass volatiles. An enhancer gas is injected from the top to gasify the char. The product syngas is obtained at the bottom of the reactor and sent to the water-gas shift reactor, followed by pressure swing adsorption and acid gas removal unit for hydrogen production. The reduced oxygen carriers then enter the regeneration step, wherein they are oxidized by steam to produce additional hydrogen, along with the complete regeneration of the oxygen carriers.Initially, process simulations are performed to optimize the system performance, and consequently, the reaction conditions are determined. The experiments are carried out in three significant sets- simulated moving bed experiments to study the feasibility, moving bed bench-scale experiments, and TGA experiments to study regeneration characteristics. The simulated moving bed consists of two layers of OC particles: the lower layer of reduced particles and the upper layer of oxidized OC particles. This arrangement is made to simulate a moving bed system closely. The biomass is fed using a lock hopper system from the top of the reactor. In a moving bed system, the biomass is mixed with the OC particles and fed from the top of the reactor at a controlled rate. The TGA experiments are designed to study the regeneration characteristics of reduced OC particles in CO2and steam environments. The regeneration step is also replicated in the moving bed system wherein the reduced OC particles and steam move counter-currently for complete regeneration of OC particles. High-purity syngas is obtained with a high H2/CO ratio and fed to the water-gas shift reactor to produce high-purity hydrogen. Hydrogen generation from both steps- Biomass gasification and OC regeneration, can be accounted for a high H2/CO ratio.Various biomass feedstocks have been studied in the system, and high-purity syngas is obtained in each case, proving the system’s applicability to different feedstocks. Further selectivity and conversion are improved by adding dopants to the OC material.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a method of carbon dioxide removal which will be a critical component of CO2removal and storage from the atmosphere. In the IPCC-AR5 report, it was concluded that warming below 2oC could not be achieved if BECCS deployment is limited (high confidence). This is because BECCS is theoretically carbon-negative as CO2is captured by both biomass growth and the coupled downstream CO2capture. The thermochemical conversion of biomass (e.g., gasification) are among the most prominent methods for BECCS as they combine proven technologies (e.g., thermal gasifiers) with emerging carbon capture systems. Unfortunately, they are often hampered by high temperatures and pressures, feedstock purity requirements, pure oxidant demand, and low actualized CO2capture ability. Alkaline thermal treatment (ATT) is a promising and robust BECCS method which can run at mild temperatures and pressures (<500oC, 1 bar) and produces carbon-free high-purity H2(>90% v/v) in a single reactor. Hydroxide salts are utilized during the ATT reaction (e.g., NaOH, KOH, LiOH, etc.), facilitating the degradation and conversion of organic matter. Tandemly, carbon from the biomass is captured in the form of stable carbonate salts (e.g., Na2CO3). In this study, we report on the H2production and CO2capture potential of a wide variety of difficult-to-process biomass sources using alkaline thermal treatment, including wet and salty seaweeds, construction and demolition organics, and plastics commingled with marine wastes. Characterization of the reaction intermediates and products is performed to better elucidate the underlying reactive mechanisms. Gas-phase reforming catalysts, such as Ni/ZrO2, are utilized to boost H2-yields and increase the degree of energy recovery from the biomass. Finally, regeneration methods to recover the spent alkaline material for further conversion are considered, including metathesis with Ca-rich industrial wastes or molten salt electrolysis for carbonate electrosplitting.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWorldwide, as corn crop yield is more than 1 bty, significant amount of corn stover is available for bioprocessing. In this study, we investigated hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of corn stover at 225°C to 300 °C and 800- 1300 psi (system autogenous pressure) using different catalytic materials and surfactants. Catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction (CHTL) of corn stover and derived unhydrolyzed solids (UHS) was performed at different processing conditions of temperature, initial nitrogen pressure, biomass to water ratio, and catalyst loading. Presence of a surfactant is known to change the wettability, reduce the hydrophilicity and increase interfacial surface area, which can influence characteristics of hydrochar as well as distribution of liquified products, mainly the C1-C3 carboxylic acids. HTL processing resulted in product gas, aqueous biocrude, heavy bio-oil (HBO) and hydrochar. The aqueous biocrude was characterized by the TOC analyzer and gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to understand extent of liquefied carbon and oxygenated hydrocarbons, respectively. Both hydrochar and HBO were analyzed by the elemental analyzer and HHVs were estimated based on C, H, N and O content. Liquid - liquid extraction methodology was developed to separate phenol/substituted phenols from aqueous biocrude. HTL processing, separation methodologies, process engineering aspects and scale-up strategies will be presented for the conversion of corn stover and UHS into value-added products.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCatalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) is an efficient way to produce stabilized low-oxygen biogenic oil from lignocellulosic biomass, which is an abundant and domestically available feedstock and does not contribute to the competition between food and energy. Hydrotreating can further convert CFP oil into various renewable transportation fuels. Due to the growth in electrification of the light-duty transportation sectors a large distillate hydrotreating capacity is available and ready for use. The studies on co-hydrotreating of CFP oil with petroleum streams can provide routes to incorporate biogenic oil into fuel pool with minimal capital costs. Previously, renewable diesel with a high indicated cetane number of 45 was produced through co-hydrotreating of CFP oil with straight-run diesel (SRD) under a typical refinery SRD hydrotreating condition, which transferred up to 97% of biogenic carbon from CFP oil into final renewable diesel product. In this project, co-hydrotreating of CFP oil with SRD and co-hydrocracking of CFP oil with a mixture of vacuum gas oil (VGO) and light cycle oil (LCO) were conducted. CFP oil with 22% oxygen on dry basis was produced from pine in a bench-scale fluidized bed reactor over an HZSM-5 catalyst, after which the CFP oil was hydroprocessed in a continuous trickle-bed reactor over commercial catalysts. The chemical composition of the co-hydroprocessed products was characterized by elemental analysis, simulated distillation, GCxGC-TOFMS-FID and GC-VUV. The co-hydroprocessed products were fractionated by distillation into fuel cuts, and selected fuel properties (density, viscosity, heating value, freeze point, indicated cetane number) for the co-hydroprocessed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) product were evaluated and compared with ASTM requirements. Stand-alone hydroprocessing of the petroleum products was studied under the same condition as comparisons. Producing SAF from co-hydroprocessing of CFP oil with petroleum streams has great potential in mitigating GHG emissions at the same time reducing the fuel production costs by making the most of the existing refinery infrastructure, workforce, and institutional knowledge.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLignin is one of three major structural components of the lignocellulosic biomass and the second most abundant natural polymer. Due to its highly heterogenous molecular structure, lignin contributes most of the recalcitrance to biomass valorization. Fast pyrolysis is a promising thermochemical process for lignin valorization, allowing less char formation. However, the knowledge of the reaction mechanism for this process still needs to be completed, and many information gaps exist among the experimental and computational studies on this topic. To address it, we employ the concept of automated reaction network generation and kinetic modeling to study lignin pyrolysis using the model compounds. The computerized reaction network generation approach is a beneficial and realistic choice to do microkinetic modeling for such a complex and large reactive system. In this work, we constructed detailed reaction mechanisms for the fast pyrolysis process of anisole and guaiacol. These oxygenated aromatic compounds are the pyrolysate from lignin pyrolysis and serve as model lignin compounds. These compounds are also used as surrogates for lignin-derived primary tar. Therefore, a better understanding of gas-phase reactions among the species that evolved during the pyrolysis of these model compounds also helps better understand other thermal conversion processes, including gasification and combustion. These model compounds have been experimentally investigated, and specific product spectra have been reported in the literature. However, many missing links exist for the pyrolysis process for both model compounds. We employed the automated reaction network generation approach using these two model compounds and performed extensive reaction pathway analysis that would be insightful for bridging the existing information gaps. The resulting simulation from our work shows good agreement with the experimentally reported concentration profiles of pyrolysis products. We checked the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the generated reaction networks and analyzed the pathways for forming major products. We identified several areas of improvement so that this relatively less conventional approach to microkinetic modeling can be further used for models with similar complexity. Therefore, this work is the foundation for the successive model extension to automated reaction network generation and microkinetic modeling for lignin pyrolysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe search for renewable alternatives to current industrial products, processes, and technologies has been a priority for the field of catalysis during the past decades. In particular, research efforts have focused on utilizing abundant, renewable resources available in the United States, such as biomass, and transforming them into fuels and value-added products in a sustainable manner. C­rude oil, a non-renewable unrefined petroleum feedstock subject to depletion, has served as the principal energy source for processing and refinement into transportation fuels. Thus, both environmental and economic reasons have driven the development of biological, catalytic, and thermochemical pathways for deconstruction, conversion, and further upgrading of biomass into advanced materials. The thermochemical pathway for conversion typically involves hydrogenation, dehydration, hydrodeoxygenation, isomerization, and carbon-carbon coupling reactions. Carbon-carbon coupling reactions are key in the catalytic conversion step of the process, as they enable the construction of complex organic molecules by forming new carbon-carbon bonds and can be rate limiting under a variety of conditions. In this work, propionaldehyde and ethylene were studied as model compounds representative of cellulosic-derived biomass deconstruction products. Conversion of these compounds into longer carbon-chain structures over aluminosilicate materials via three coupling routes, including aldol condensation, Prins reaction, and oligomerization was studied. The effects of ethylene : propionaldehyde feed ratio, reaction temperature, and catalyst type (H-Al-MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, SiO2-Al2O3) were investigated. Our findings suggest that propionaldehyde self-aldol condensation to form 2-methyl-2-pentenal is the predominant pathway, followed by the acid-catalyzed Prins reaction between ethylene and propionaldehyde to form 1,3-pentadiene.",

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the power source of EVs and the anode of LIBs is made of graphite. This study aims to develop and optimize a novel process for the production of battery-grade graphite from a renewable precursor, pyrolysis oil, using iron as the graphitization catalyst. Catalytic graphitization was carried out under relatively moderate conditions (1500 °C, 20 hours) to reduce costs and environmental impacts as compared to incumbent graphitization technologies. After graphitization, the residual catalyst was separated by washing the graphite-iron mixture with hydrochloric acid under reflux. The efficiency of iron removal was studied using both X-ray fluorescenc (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) techniques. To evaluate the quality of graphite, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were applied as the preliminary screeing tools. The optimized graphite sample demonstrated excellent reversible capacity (>350 mAh/g) with minimal capacity loss over 100 cycles and a high initial Coulombic efficiency (90%) when applied as a lithium-ion battery anode, thereby making this technology potentially competitive with commercially available battery-grade graphite.",

The objective of this study was to examine the factors that affect the production of C1, C2-C4, and C5+in FTS process, and then optimize the critical factors utilising factorial design and response surface techniques. The parameters evaluated were reaction temperature, reaction pressure and the crystallite size of cobalt. The effects of these factors and their potential for synergy were explored simultaneously using multivariate DOE, with the yield of different hydrocarbon composition selectivity's as the measured responses. In the concept generation phase, optimization was based on the literature consulted, which proved to be an effective method for determining the optimization parameters. The detailed conceptual design included the generation of models using statistical methods and response surface models. Finally, the optimized design was validated using catalysts and parameters obtained during the optimization process, and this were compared to the output recorded in the theoretical modelling. The optimized parameters resulted in performance consistency, with the theoretical model for each group of hydrocarbons being validated by actual experiments. The established models were seen to characterize hydrocarbon distributions accurately and repeatedly over a wide range of reaction conditions (200-270 °C, 5-20 Bar, and 3-26 nm) using a cobalt-based catalyst.

By leveraging additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing methods and small-scale fluid physics, the CFTR enables intensified catalytic reactions such as hydrogenations with facile catalyst replenishment. The central concept of this reactor paradigm is the temporary trapping of colloidal solutions of metallic nanoparticle catalysts via capillary forces within a reactor through which reactant gases and liquids flow. We discuss the design, fabrication, operation, and analysis of such reactors, along with demonstrations of online catalyst recovery and replenishment. We start by establishing the operating limits of the capillary force traps in a CFTR with a simple proof-of-concept design. We then implement a model reaction to evaluate the performance of the CFTR, demonstrating complete conversion of hydrogenation of 1-hexene to n-hexane catalyzed by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) stabilized rhodium nanoparticle (RhNP) catalysts suspended in water. Lastly, we show a facile way of replenishing used catalyst to maintain performance throughout the five-hour operating period of the reactor, and discuss tuning reactor performance when catalyst deactivation occurs. This work illustrates the possibility of harnessing 3D printing for more sophisticated novel capillary flow trap designs, and opens up new routes for ‘designer’ flow reactors for multiphase catalytic reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractProgrammable catalysis is an emerging catalyst design strategy in which temporal manipulation of a catalyst is predicted to enhance reaction rates by orders of magnitude. To date, there have been several microkinetic analyses of programmable catalysis by both our group and others.[1-3]However, an understanding of how parameter uncertainty impacts microkinetic predictions of dynamic turnover frequency (TOF) enhancement is yet to be established. In this work, we elucidate the impact of error in linear scaling relations (LSR) and Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations on predicted dynamic TOF enhancement. We begin our analysis by analyzing an A-to-B toy reaction under ideal differential conversion conditions. The uncertainty in model-predicted TOF is quantified using a distributed evaluation of local sensitivity analysis (DELSA); this method was chosen over a full variance-based global sensitivity analysis (e.g.,Sobol’s method) due to its lower computational cost.[4,5]The uncertainty space of LSR and BEP parameters are sampled quasi-randomly assuming a uniform distribution. After establishing how a simple reaction is affected by LSR and BEP uncertainty, we expand our analysis to more complex toy reaction mechanisms to investigate whether errors dampen out in series or parallel mechanisms. The microkinetic model and uncertainty analysis are implemented in Julia 1.8. Uncertainties in microkinetic predictions of rate for a static catalyst can be significant (ca. 3 orders of magnitude from the median prediction[6]) and are not yet quantified for programmable catalysts.

    "abstract": "AbstractAmmoxidation (AMO) of propene over bismuth molybdate (BMO)-based catalysts to produce acrylonitrile (ACN) has been used since the 1950s. Acrylonitrile is the precursor to polyacrylonitrile (PAN), which can in turn be manufactured into acrylic fiber or carbon fiber (CF). CF is used in many applications due to its lightweight and high tensile strength nature. As the demand for CF is growing rapidly, manufacturing capacity of ACN is bound to increase. Instead of building in large-scale production, which is costly, small-scale production could be more economic.Forced dynamic operation (FDO) utilizing feed modulation is suitable for small-volume reactors. In FDO, the reactor is operated such that the composition is periodically changed to achieve enhanced product selectivity and yield. One intuitive aspect in improving yield via FDO is the utilization of lattice oxidation. BMO-based catalysts are well-known for their dynamic oxygen storage capacity (DOSC). However, exactly how DOSC impacts FDO for this reaction is not well-established.In this work, we applied FDO for AMO over transition metal promoted BMO (denoted HM-BMO).FDO schemes with changing compositions of reactant gases (C3H6, NH3and O2) and conditions (cycle period, duty cycle) were tested to identify the best pathway in improving ACN yield. We found a higher than steady state ACN productivity in an FDO scheme that periodically switches between the normal feed and an O2feed (Fig. 1a). The so-called ACN “spikes” indicate FDO parameters could be adjusted so that the time-averaged ACN yield can exceed those of steady-state operation (SSO). We also found that the DOSC of the BMO-based catalysts is correlated with ACN productivity in FDO. By tuning promoter element ratios, the FDO performance can be optimized (Fig. 1b). Our results show that FDO can provide promising ACN production rates compared with SSO, potentially contributing to the pursuit of economic modular ACN manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEthylene is a valuable commodity chemical traditionally produced through catalytic steam cracking of larger hydrocarbons. However, the endothermicity of catalytic steam cracking results in high energy demands to achieve desirable ethylene yields. Selective catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene has proven to be an attractive alternative due to its exothermicity and light alkane feedstock. It is speculated that the simultaneous presence of gaseous ethane and oxygen during ODH results in overoxidation to COx, hence decreasing ethylene yields. It is proposed that higher ethylene yields are achievable by promoting reactions between ethane and selective oxygen stored within metal oxide catalysts as opposed to unselective gaseous oxygen. To demonstrate this, we compare conventional steady state to concentration forcing (dynamic) operation of ethane ODH. Fig. 1a and b plots carbon selectivities as functions of ethane conversion over 3wt% VOxand 7wt% MoO3Al2O3catalysts respectively. Fig.1a shows no significant difference between dynamic and steady state carbon selectivies over the 3wt% VOxAl2O3catalyst. However, fig. 1b demonstrates higher ethylene selectivities via dynamic operation over a 7wt% MoO3Al2O3catalyst. We explain this difference in dynamic performance of supported VOxand MoO3catalysts based the O2dependencies of unselective overoxidation reactions. More specifically, improvement via concentration forcing over MoO3catalysts were rationalized based on higher O2sensitivities of unselective overoxidation reactions compared to the selective ODH reaction. All reaction rates over the VOxcatalyst are independent of oxygen pressure, unlike the MoOxcatalyst over which selective and unselective rates are zero and positive fractional order in O2, respectively. Our work presents a method for interpreting dynamic enhancement during ethane ODH from the standpoint of apparent O2reaction orders of different steps in the overall reaction network, and could be used to provide kinetic criteria for improving oxidation processes through non-steady state operation.",

In this study, application of voltages up to ±6V between the graphene and the Si substrate resulted in significant changes in binding energy with either positive or negative charges accumulated on the catalyst. Temperature programmed desorption of CO adsorbed onto Pt revealed a significant shift in peak temperature up to ΔTpeak~±40 ⁰C relative to the uncharged film. Further characterization such as voltage-applied IR spectroscopy, c-TEM, STM, XPS, and UPS were used to verify and to characterize the behavior of the Pt film on the graphene.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe production of high-volume chemicals, like hydrogen, ammonia, and small olefins need significant energy, traditionally met through combustion of natural gas, which yields considerable greenhouse gas emissions. In response, electrification methods such as Joule heating, are emerging as a potential alternative, providing means for rapid heating and greater control over kinetics. Despite the early development of mathematical theory underlying periodic control, experimental demonstrations have been limited, largely due to the significant inertia and slow intrinsic dynamics associated with such systems. Furthermore, the development of a comprehensive modeling framework capable of accommodating rapid, Joule heating with nonlinear temperature control functions, for catalytic reactors employing detailed microkinetic models, remains outstanding.Experimental demonstrations have also remained rare.We have recently demonstrated the impact of dynamic electrification.1,2This study seeks to assess the impact of dynamic operation via rapid pulse heating, leveraging state-of-the-art experimental technology and computation. Our results demonstrate a nuanced understanding of how Joule heating can boost system performance via forced time-varying input perturbation, leveraging Joule heating setups and theoretical advancements. Our fundamental modeling study reveals improvements in simple gas-phase systems using prototypical reactions, without requiring additional nonlinearities beyond those inherent in Arrhenius rate laws. Our modeling framework reveals general guidelines for leveraging pulsing to optimize system performance depending on the characteristics of a given reaction. Moreover, we elucidate the interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics in endothermic shale gas utilization chemistries through our experimental findings.Overall, our findings serve as a foundation for future investigations into dynamic electrification as a promising alternative to traditional heating methods towards achieving enhanced performance.ReferencesQ.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe shift from centralized to distributed chemical manufacturing (DCheM) has driven innovation in microreactor technology and reactor operation. DCheM enables localized, small-footprint chemical processing in geographically-remote locations where transportation infrastructure is costly or inexistent. The adoption of competitive DCheM systems requires to operate reactors beyond the limits of thermodynamic equilibrium. Such operation windows are unlocked by short transport lengths in microreactors, enabling innovative modes of operation like dynamic catalysis that enhances reactor performance through the modulation of process inputs like temperature or pressure, in place of traditional static operation. Several studies have demonstrated rate enhancements from dynamic operation, which can be attributed to distinct phenomena: tuning of surface coverage for optimal energetics, operation in favorable thermodynamic conditions at the timescales of catalytic steps, or surface cleaning.There’s a need for reactors with sharp input modulation at kinetic timescales and fast transport to study the contribution of each phenomenon to catalytic enhancement, without competing transport effects. To this end, we have designed a microreactor platform for oxidant/reductant feed switching to study the induced effects on reaction rate, selectivity, and catalyst deactivation for the partial oxidation of methane. The reactor is a wash-coated glass capillary designed to operate in plug flow for precise gas pulses and negligible thermal gradients. Pressure tests and residence time distributions validated near plug flow operation and millisecond residence times, critical for modulation above 1Hz. Feed modulation achieved square waveforms at frequencies up to 25Hz. The reactor is integrated in a gas chromatograph, providing fast MS/FID for analysis of products and temperature programmed oxidation to measure catalyst activity, selectivity, and coking. Dynamic experiments revealed that turnover responds to input concentration oscillations and time-averaged conversion at low temperature was maximized at the stoichiometric duty of complete oxidation which is dominant in an isothermal condition.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMicrokinetic models are useful tools for catalyst design. When kinetic parameters for each elementary step are identified, rate limiting steps and critical intermediates can be confirmed. Steady-state kinetic studies are successful in parameter identification for traditional kinetic models, such as, Langmuir-Hinshelwood expressions. Identifying parameters in complex microkinetic models accurately with steady-state studies can be difficult due to limited information in available data. Transient kinetic studies providing information on reaction network and surface coverage are more conducive for parameter identification of the microkinetic model.Therefore, parameter identifiability of a representative microkinetic model through a transient kinetic study is investigated and compared with the parameter identifiability from a steady-state kinetic study. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism is adopted for the proposed microkinetic model. In the identifiability investigation process, the microkinetic model is identified with synthetic reactor performances generated from the same model with preset kinetic parameters. If deviation between fitted and preset kinetic parameters’ values are small while confidence intervals of fitted parameters are narrow, parameters in the microkinetic model are practically identifiable. For clear evaluation, two criteria using the deviations and the confidence intervals are defined. A pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) is applied to the inlet concentration to induce transient behavior in a kinetic study for better practical identifiability. An appropriately tuned transient kinetic study outperforms a steady-state kinetic study in parameter identification of the microkinetic model. Parameters are more accurately identified with a PRBS inlet profile than the widely used single pulse. A good practical parameter identifiability is reconciled utilizing a PRBS inlet. The influence of rate-limiting steps, sampling time, and noise on practical parameter identifiability are also investigated. Collectively, this work demonstrates the potential of PRBS transient kinetics studies to identify elementary reaction kinetic parameters, and delineates requirements of sampling time and noise needed from experimental studies to provide meaningful data.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMechanistic analyses of catalytic systems in many cases rely on the accurate estimation of sensitivities of reaction rates to reactant/product partial pressures - sensitivities that enable identification of possible rate expressions and plausible reaction sequences. The most common method for measuring such sensitivities is the use of low conversion (or residence time) rate data with varying partial pressures of reactants and products. The presence of product inhibitory effects – not uncommon in catalytic partial oxidation reactions – makes it highly challenging to rigorously measure rates, even at very low conversions. This talk will discuss some of the challenges encountered in interpreting low-conversion data for the oxidation of ethane over bulk nickel oxide catalysts, and the manner in which (side-)product inhibition obfuscates both rate parameters, as well as mechanistic inferences derived therefrom.Product co-feed experiments generating differential beds when used to develop Mars-van Krevelen kinetic models for ethane partial and total oxidation are insufficient to explain integral data at low residence times that probe lower ranges of hydroxyl/carbonate coverages than those prevalent in differential co-feed experiments. Measured (average) rates deviate from true ones even at conversions as low as 0.1%, with apparent rates being more sensitive to residence time at low, rather than high conversions (Figure 1). Estimation of rate parameters and mechanisms over excess oxygen-containing nickel oxide requires consideration of inhibitory effects ofbothwater and CO2, unlike those over niobium-containing nickel oxides that carry exclusively lattice oxygens recalcitrant to carbonate formation. In this talk, we will describe how the quasi-equilibrated nature of recombinative water desorption steps in Mars-van Krevelen cycles result in an amplification of rate inhibitory features that are critical to consider during kinetic analysis of alkane oxidation over bulk oxides more generally.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBoron-containing heterogeneous catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), metal borides, and boron oxides, have high catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene, with excellent selectivity towards olefin compounds. Few catalysts, however, are utilized in the ODH of ethane (ODHE) to ethylene. Steam cracking, the main industrial ethylene production method, requires a high operating temperature and produces vast amounts of GHG emissions. It is very desirable to develop other ethylene production methods.We will describe the catalytic properties of a boron-containing zeolite with chabazite framework (B-CHA), which shows excellent conversion of over 22% at 580oC in the ODHE, with selectivity of more than 87% towards ethylene. The stability of the B-CHA catalyst was tested and we found that B-CHA achieves even higher conversion (27%) than at the beginning and maintains high ethylene selectivity (86%) after 60 h of reaction. A kinetics study regarding the activation energy, oxygen and ethane partial pressure dependences on the ethane consumption rate is also investigated. Several characterization methods including 1D and 2D boron NMR, FTIR, UV-Vis and XPS are used in the identification of active sites. A combination of the kinetic study and the identification of boron species, we propose the ODHE reaction network over the B-CHA catalyst.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOlefin metathesis is a versatile strategy that finds use in numerous applications, from the synthesis of fine chemicals to the large-scale production of petroleum commodities. Herein, we report on the synthesis of a series of amorphous and porous molybdenum silicate microspheres (Mo-SiO2) with varying Mo contents (1.6 to 11 wt.%) and investigate their reactivity using heterogeneous propylene metathesis as the probe reaction. The Mo-SiO2microspheres were synthesized by non-aqueous condensation of a hybrid molybdenum biphenyldicarboxylate-based precursor solution with (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane. Characterizations of the synthesized microspheres were performed with XPS,29Si solid-state NMR, SEM, and nitrogen adsorption isotherms. Results from in-situ DRUV-Vis and ToF-SIMS revealed that the microspheres comprised mainly atomically dispersed MoOxspecies. In-situ FTIR of pyridine adsorption at 150 °C revealed Lewis acid sites on all microspheres, and pyridinium ions from Bronsted acid sites only on Mo-SiO2with Mo content ≥ 6.7 wt.%. H2-TPD revealed enhanced reducibility of the Mo-SiO2microspheres with increasing Mo content. Remarkably, the microspheres with low Mo content (1.5-3.6 wt.%) exhibited almost two orders of magnitude higher steady-state propylene metathesis rates at 200 °C compared to conventional silica-supported MoOxcatalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, resulting in the highest molybdenum content normalized site time yields of 0.11 s-1. However, the metathesis reactivity of Mo-SiO2(catalyst mass normalized rates and Mo content normalized site time yields) starts to decrease when Mo content is higher than 4 wt.%. We ascribe these decreases in reactivity primarily to the excessive reducibility of the Mo-SiO2microsphere with high Mo content, leading to the formation of surface acetate that obstructs the surface MoO2active site. These findings suggest Mo-SiO2microspheres with high olefin metathesis reactivity as promising potential catalysts for industrial applications and provide insights into the correlation between Bronsted acidity, reducibility, and metathesis reactivity of the catalysts for advanced catalyst design.",

    "abstract": "AbstractReverse water gas shift (RWGS) is a promising technology for producing syngas from CO2. Although copper-doped ceria (Cu/CeO2) is a potentially effective catalyst for RWGS, limited progress has been made in elucidating CO2adsorption and reaction mechanism and the relationship between the microstructure of the catalyst and its performance in RWGS. In this work, Cu/CeO2was synthesized using the reverse micro emulsion (RME) method and its performance was evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and various experimental techniques, including XRD, ICP, XPS, CO2TPD, and in situ FTIR. The catalytic performance of Cu/CeO2, evaluated from 300 to 600 °C showed that all samples of Cu/CeO2were 100% selective to CO generation, with higher doping concentrations displaying conversion values significantly better than pure ceria at higher temperatures (500-600°C). Characterization results from the catalyst showed no distinct phase of copper or copper oxides, indicating that copper was atomically incorporated into ceria, and this was also confirmed using DFT based investigations. CO2adsorption energetics calculated from DFT and CO2TPD results show that the adsorption energy increases with the increase in the concentration of Cu. DFT calculations also reveal that Cu-doping enhances CO2reactivity by introducing oxygen vacancies, that ultimately lead to more under-coordinated surface atoms and active sites. Furthermore, reaction pathways determined from DFT and in situ FTIR, revealed consistent key reaction intermediates, i.e., carbonate and carboxylate, on both CeO2and Cu/CeO2surfaces, suggesting that the increase in the number of oxygen vacancies is mainly responsible for the superior catalytic activity. Overall, the combined theoretical and experimental study provides mechanistic insights into CO2activation and the role of copper doping in enhancing the activity of the RWGS reaction on ceria. These findings could serve as valuable guidelines for the development of highly active and selective RWGS catalysts.",

However, to computationally explore nonidealized catalytic systems at more realistic conditions, we must make this connection explicit so that the correct quantities are extracted from models. This talk will focus on the fundamental thermodynamics that feed into these connections as well as their practical computation using, specifically, convex hull construction. Convex hulls are extensively used in the alloy sciences but can easily be translated to computational catalysis without a great deal of modification, which will be covered. We will provide examples from our research where the utility of convex hulls are well highlighted.

We employ a gradient-less recirculating batch reactor to obtain rates and selectivities which depend intrinsically on extent of oxide conversion. Oxygen selectivity to H2on Bi2O3exceeding 98% persists even when >50% of lattice oxygen atoms have been removed from the oxide, and upon repeated redox cycling, suggesting that the chemical characteristics of Bi2O3which enable SHC are innate to Bi-O bonds and do not depend on morphological characteristics which inherently are affected during partial reduction of the metal oxide. We synthesize Bi2O3samples exhibiting unique crystallographic unit cells at ambient conditions and again illustrate unchanging selectivities to hydrogen combustion in stoichiometric experiments. We probe the relevance of oxygen diffusion and surface reactions present in redox cycles via dwell experiments to illustrate that oxygen diffusion does not limit H2combustion rates during SHC on Bi2O3particles. Applying metrics for rates which depend instantaneously on density of exposed surface oxygen species during stoichiometric reduction cycles, we evaluate the kinetic dependence of observed H2combustion rates on gas phase reductant partial pressures.

    "abstract": "AbstractLight olefins are critical chemical building blocks in the petrochemical industry, but the current industrial processes have significant shortcomings involving energy intensity and coke formation. Thus, ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (EODH) is an attractive route for ethylene production. NiO-based catalysts show promise for EODH reactions at relatively low temperatures, and the ethylene selectivity can be greatly increased via incorporation of transition metal promoters. However,the catalytic effect of the promoter is difficult to predicta prioridue to the lack of insights into the working catalyst surface structure.Here, we address this challenge by screening the stability of a series of M-NiO catalysts, simultaneously determining the effect of facet ((111), (100), (110)), promoter element (V, Mo, Sn, W, Nb, Ti, Zr), promoter placement (surface, subsurface), and defects formation (oxygen vacancy, Ni vacancy). This study combines density functional theory andab initiophase diagrams. Using (100) facet as an example (Figure 1), the stability of each M-NiO surface was determined by calculating the Gibbs free formation energy of formation over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. From the phase diagrams, we can see that the V, Mo, and Nb promoters’ preferential configuration is in the subsurface under EODH conditions (300-500oC, ~1 bar), while the Sn, Ti, and Zr promoters prefer locating in the surface layer. Notably, the majority of thermodynamically preferred M-NiO structures have no vacancies under EODH environments, indicating the promoted (100) surfaces have maintained a fully oxidated state. The W promoter is an exception as it shows a similar preference for both the fully oxidized and single surface oxygen vacancy under EODH conditions. Overall, this approach both enables the identification of surface structures present under EODH conditions and reduces the number of structures required for sampling the EODH potential energy surface in future sequential studies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWater electrolysis has been considered a green process for hydrogen production. Conventional electrolysis is limited by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), leading to high energy input. In addition, the temporal spatial coupling of the production of H2and O2can cause issues associated with safety, economic feasibility, and system flexibility. Herein, we reported our work on replacing OER with an electrocatalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (EOD) of biorenewable aldehydes for bipolar H2production at low cell voltages and high current densities. Experimental and DFT studies suggested a reasonable barrier for C-H dissociation on Cu surface, mainly through the diol intermediate, with the potential-dependent competition with Cannizzaro reaction. We revealed that EOD on metallic Cu surface was linked to an autocatalytic Cu oxides reduction by aldehydes along with H2evolution. The EOD kinetics and durability was further enhanced by a porous CuAg catalyst prepared by a galvanic replacement method. We engineered a bipolar H2production system using membrane-electrode assembly-based flow cells to facilitate mass transport, achieving a combined faradaic efficiency (FE) of ~200% to H2and the maximum H2partial current density of 248 and 390 mA/cm2at cell voltages of 0.4 V and 0.6 V, respectively. We further studied other CuM (M= Pt, Pd, Au) bimetallic catalysts for EOD reaction, and found that dispersing Pt into Cu (CuPt) exhibited a unique synergistic effect for furfural EOD possibly via efficient C-H cleavage on Cu and favorable furfural binding on Pt. The CuPt anode-based flow electrolyzer has achieved a higher current density of 498 mA/cm2at a low cell voltage of 0.6 V and FE of >80% to H2. Inexpensive dialysis membranes and non-noble metal HER catalysts are possibly used for bipolar H2production, which provides an alternative approach for distributed manufacturing of green hydrogen and carbon chemicals in the future.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAmong the several existing micro-/nano-scale energy storage systems, micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) as promising candidates to power miniaturized portable/wearable electronics have attracted tremendous attention due to their unique merits. However, several key issues such as the relatively low energy density, unsatisfactory rate capability, and narrow operating voltage need to be improved before further applications. Here, we report that the Ti3C2TxMXene-derived quantum dots (QDs) with rich functional groups and abundant active sites are synthesized and employed as electrode material for the MSCs. The resulting MSCs exhibit high-specific capacitance, outstanding rate performance, and fast frequency responsibility in both aqueous electrolytes and ionic liquid electrolytes. This device also displays an excellent high-rate capability demonstrated by the perfect rectangle CV shape even at ultra-high scan rate up to 1000 V·s-1, a high area specific capacitance of 828.6 μF·cm-2, and a long-term cycling stability manifested by high capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. The remarkable capacitor performance presented here is attributed to the unique surface and structural features as well as the chemical state, enabling well-exposed Ti3C2TxQDs to the electrolyte and easy transport of the ions and electrons during the charge/discharge process.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogen has unique advantages as an energy carrier, with a high energy density and abilities for long-term storage and conversion between electricity and chemical bonds.[1] Although hydrogen currently has a significant role in transportation and agriculture, its use in energy consumption overall has been limited, particularly in the case of electrochemical water splitting. With decreasing electricity prices, electrolysis cost reductions can be achieved and allow for an opportunity for greater use.In proton exchange membrane (PEM) -based electrolyzers, long-term durability issues arise when targeting low-cost hydrogen production, both through intermittent power inputs and anticipated PGM loading reductions. Accelerated stress tests have been developed that focus on anode catalyst layer durability and membrane/transport layer interfaces, due to intermittent and start-stop operation.[2] In general, performance changes manifest through kinetics and correspond to catalyst migration, interfacial tearing, and layer changes, including catalyst agglomeration and ionomer segregation.[3] Mitigation strategies, both operational and materials, have been developed to lessen these losses.In anion exchange membrane (AEM) systems, the alkaline environment allows for non-PGM components and improved durability at high pH. Operation in AEM electrolysis includes supporting (hydroxide, carbonate) and unsupported (water) electrolytes, and outlook depends on the intended market.[4] Recent component advancements have enabled high performance, particularly in supporting electrolytes. PGM-free catalysts are readily available that are competitive with and can exceed the activity and stability of their PEM-PGM counterparts. Differences in catalyst particle sizes and ink stability, and transport layer properties, however, create challenges in optimizing catalyst layer properties and interfacial contact, and minimizing catalyst layer resistances.[5,6] Select ionomer and catalyst combinations have been evaluated for differences in ionomer-catalyst affinity and their impact on activity and stability in the oxygen evolution reaction. These experiments demonstrate the complications of developing a single set of materials and test protocols for component evaluations.",

The requirements to achieve chemical conversion with high selectivity has motivated the design and synthesis of new nanoscale catalysts. One materials synthesis strategy, atomic layer deposition (ALD), a technique widely used for making computer chips, has now emerged as an exciting tool to be used in the study, design, and fabrication of heterogeneous catalysts. This talk will introduce ALD and describe our research applying ALD to perform fundamental studies of supported metal catalysts, with focus on using the layer-by-layer synthesis permitted by ALD to generate catalysts with a high level of control over composition, structure, and thickness. We study the conversion of syngas to synthetic liquid fuels and high-value chemicals using ALD-derived catalysts. I will describe how atomically precise ALD titration of additive components onto supported metal catalysts allows for the tuning of activity and selectivity and provides new insights into structure-property relationships in these systems. We will also introduce recent work applying these thin film materials to Li metal batteries, in which ALD interfacial layers achieve control over lithium metal morphology and improve battery performance.

The obtained lignin is enriched with beta-O-4 linkage, and is not condensed, and is water-soluble. The water-soluble lignin can be separated as cleavable (cyclic acetal-linked) surfactant through membrane dialysis. Xylose can be effectively recovered from xylose-derived dioxolo through acidolysis.

    "abstract": "AbstractValorization of lignocellulosic biomass residues into functional oligosaccharides with prebiotic activity has attracted great interest from both environmental and economic perspectives. Cellulose and hemicelluloses, the two structural polysaccharides naturally present in the matrix of lignocellulosic biomass, can be depolymerized into soluble oligosaccharides, such as cello-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS), which are non-digestible and fermentable by the health-promoting gut microbiota, making them potential prebiotics. Currently, XOS are industrially produced from corncob xylan via alkaline extraction followed by enzymatic hydrolysis by xylanases. However, cellulose (~30% in corncob) remains unutilized, and the process economy is limited by the high cost associated with enzymes and the pretreatment step. Herein, we report a facile and efficient chemical method (top-down synthesis) for the co-production of potential prebiotic gluco-oligosaccharides (GlcOS) and XOS mixtures from unpretreated corn stover. Specifically, cellulose and xylan in corn stover are subject to simultaneous hydrolysis and glycosylation (SHG) in concentrated sulfuric acid (60–84%) under mild conditions (50–70 °C, 5–60 min). After the removal of lignin residues, a soluble oligosaccharide product is obtained, which is identified as a mixture of GlcOS and XOS with mostly 2–6 monomer units, linked by diverse glycosidic linkages (α- and β-(1→6/4/3/2/1)). The total yield of corn stover-derived oligosaccharides (CS-OS) is close to the theoretical yield, with minimal loss into monosugars and acid-induced degradation products (e.g., furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural). The prebiotic activity of CS-OS was assessed via in vitro fermentation with different lactic acid bacteria. CS-OS could promote the growth of certain Lactobacillus and Pediococcus strains (potential probiotics), outperforming two commercial prebiotic oligosaccharides (fructo- and isomalto-oligosaccharides). Furthermore, a mechanism study was conducted to reveal the impact of oligosaccharide size (degree of polymerization, DP) and glycosidic linkages on their utilization by probiotic bacteria. Preferrable utilization of DP 2–3 over DP 4–7 oligosaccharides was observed, and the bacterial ability to utilize α/β-(1→6/4) linkages varies significantly depending on the available genomes essential for oligosaccharide transport and catabolism. Overall, this study demonstrated the production of value-added oligosaccharides as potential prebiotics from lignocellulosic biomass, which is an emerging sector in response to the burgeoning market of prebiotics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe passage of the 2018 Farm Bill in the United States directed the USDA to establish national regulations for the cultivation of industrial hemp in the U.S. This has allowed agricultural producers to start growing industrial hemp to be used in new application routes as a feedstock for bio-based fuels and chemicals. The previous restrictions on planting and harvesting hemp have not allowed this feedstock to be sufficiently researched in the context of biochemical conversion compared to other lignocellulosic crops such as woody biomass or perennial grasses. Thus, the aim of this research is to provide a more thorough understanding on the deconstruction of industrial hemp to access both polysaccharide and lignin fractions. In this work industrial hemp was pretreated using alkaline chemistry to determine the effect on both hemicellulose and lignin removal. Increasing chemical severity confirmed that cellulose content was maintained after pretreatment, but hemicellulose and lignin removal increased under the same conditions. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated hemp produced high yields of sugar recovery (i.e. glucose and xylose) to generate a hydrolysate media for downstream fermentation. The resulting pretreatment liquor was utilized as a source for lignin separation and recovery. The recovered hemp lignin from pretreatment underwent chemical characterization using microscale analytical pyrolysis to characterize constituent monomeric components.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAbstractMiscanthus x giganteusis a widely recognized bioenergy crop that finds potential applications in a biorefinery for the production of a wide range of biofuels and biochemicals (Rivas et al., 2019). In this study we focused upon the lab-scale and pilot-scale bioprocessing of miscanthus at high solids loading for recovery of value-added products such as anthocyanins, microbial lipids and lignin-rich residue. Hydrothermal pretreatment was studied for recovering anthocyanins. The optimized pretreatment conditions (170 ºC, 10 min) led to a recovery of 94.3±1.5% w/w of the total anthocyanin content and also improved the enzymatic digestibility of the biomass, allowing recovery of 70.6±0.5% w/w of glucose at the end of 72 h of enzymatic saccharification. Based upon the lab-scale studies, the pretreatment step was scaled-up with 50 kg of miscanthus with 50% solids loading using a continuous pretreatment reactor (Cheng, Dien, Lee, & Singh, 2019) that led to a recovery of 70% w/w of total anthocyanins present in the biomass. The pretreated biomass was subjected to enzymatic saccharification at 10-50% solids loading using fed-batch operations. The highest sugar yields were obtained for 50% solids loading. The sugar concentrations of the hydrolysate were 140 g/L and 80 g/L for glucose and xylose, respectively. The hydrolysate was further used for the production of microbial lipids. While the residue left after enzymatic saccharification was found to be enriched in lignin that could further be diverted toward the production of aviation fuel precursors. Hence a detailed biorefinery concept was demonstrated by bioprocessing of miscanthus leading to the generation of multiple products.ReferencesCheng, M.-H., Dien, B. S., Lee, D. K., & Singh, V.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe pioneer 2ndgeneration cellulosic ethanol plants faced challenges due to the low fermentability of sugar hydrolysates produced by dilute acid pretreatment. This technique depolymerizes hemicelluloses, mainly xylan, in corn stover biomass, improving the digestibility of pretreated biomass solids and resulting in a mixed glucose and xylose sugar hydrolysate through enzymatic hydrolysis. However, the high temperature and low pH conditions of the reaction cause rapid sugar degradation reactions, leading to the formation of furfural from xylose and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from glucose, both of which are strong fermentation inhibitors even at low concentrations. Additionally, hemicelluloses in corn stover are heavily esterified with acetyl groups, and during dilute acid pretreatment, these groups are released, forming acetic acid, another potent inhibitor of ethanol fermentation using common organisms likeZymomonasandSaccharomycescerevisiae. The resulting sugar hydrolysate from dilute acid pretreated corn stover (hydrolyzed at 20% total solids) contains roughly 10 g/L of acetic acid, 5 g/L of furfural, and 0.5 g/L of HMF. As a result, only 50% of the xylose is utilized after 50 hours of fermentation when glucose has already been completely consumed, leading to an overall ethanol yield of around 80% after 75 hours of fermentation.The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a solution to this issue in the form of a scalable, atmospheric pressure, and low severity biomass deconstruction and fractionation process known as the Deacetylation and Mechanical Refining (DMR) process. The DMR process has exhibited exceptional performance in converting corn stover to high-concentration, low-toxicity sugars at high yields. The process involves a dilute NaOH deacetylation step to remove the acetate in biomass at atmospheric pressure (90°C), followed by mechanical refining of the deacetylated biomass using a disk refiner and a Szego mill, both commonly used in the pulping and milling industry. The entire process is carried out at low temperatures without an acid catalyst, effectively preventing the formation of furfural and HMF. Additionally, the removal of acetyl groups significantly reduces acetic acid formation during sugar hydrolysate production, resulting in high fermentation efficiency. The hydrolysate produced by DMR from corn stover (hydrolyzed at 25% total solids) resulted in an ethanol yield exceeding 98% with xylose utilization exceeding 95% in only 40 hours of fermentation due to zero furan content and very low acetic acid concentration of less than 0.5 g/L.The high sodium hydroxide usage in DMR process is beneficial to increase sugar yields while reducing enzyme usage. However, the cost of sodium hydroxide can be significant at $0.24/lb, and the high loadings required in the process can lead to high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While NaOH recovery is common in the pulp and paper industry, it is complex and capital intensive, requiring an expensive recovery boiler, lime kiln, and recausticization cycle. These processes account for approximately 50% of the total capital investment for a 2000 tonne biomass/day biorefinery plant.This study developed a chemical-recovery-free pretreatment technology for the DMR process, which potentially addresses current challenges and decrease the minimum sugar selling price. In this modified DMR process, NaOH is replaced by ammonium or potassium alkali and salts, which results in post-fermentation spent liquor that can be used as a fertilizer without requiring chemical recovery. In fact, ammonium or potassium sulfite pulping spent liquor (with low pH) has been used as a fertilizer in various countries. Additionally, the modified DMR spent liquor has a lower sulfur content due to the reduced sulfite charge. By partially absorbing CO2from downstream fermentation, the alkaline spent liquor becomes near pH-neutral, which is more beneficial for the environment and soil. This method not only reduces GHG emissions but also provides a carbon source for plants. By converting the pretreatment spent liquor into fertilizer without the need for wastewater treatment or chemical recovery, we could save at least $150MM in capital investment, and the revenue from the fertilizer could cover the cost of pretreatment chemicals. The return of nutrients, lignin, and biogenic CO2back into the soil would help balance nutrient loss and maintain soil organic carbon that is removed during the corn stover removal process. Furthermore, the chemical recovery-free process reduces the energy needed for the GHG-intensive calcination process, which could potentially reduce the carbon footprint of sugar production.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe most significant obstacle to commercially viable biofuels and bioproducts remains the cost-effective breakdown of cellulosic biomass. Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) has been acknowledged for its ability to decrease the number of process steps and eliminate the costs associated with additional saccharolytic enzymes. Current developments in the use of cellulolytic anaerobes likeClostridium thermocellumfor deconstruction, which are highly successful at solubilizing recalcitrant biomass than industry-standard fungal cellulase, provide proof-of-concept for CBP. The solubilization of both herbaceous and woody non-pretreated biomass is significantly increased by the novel and promising CBP/CT using thermophilic anaerobes combined with cotreatment (i.e., milling during fermentation). In this study ball milling and disc milling operations were used along with anaerobic fermentation as part of the CBP/CT process. The residues from the milling followed by fermentation steps were analyzed using a variety of characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) – Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Considerable differences in the microfibril structure were observed among the ball-milled and disc-milled switchgrass CBP/CT residues. The lignin, cellulose molecular weights, monolignol composition, and interunit linkages resulting from different milling conditions were investigated to understand the deconstruction mechanisms of CBP/CT. Moreover, the total lignin and sugar contents of the CBP/CT residuals provide an estimation of the process efficiency in depolymerizing the lignocellulosic matrix and fermentation of cellulosic and hemi-cellulosic sugars. Quantifying the effects of CBP/CT (mechanical disruption) on biomass will identify its current limitations and can help in developing potential improvement strategies along with the application of CBP/CT solid residuals for value-added products.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) can be one of the potential thermochemical approaches to produce biofuels and bioproducts because it does not require dewatering or drying and is able to use a wide variety of organic materials as feedstocks. In addition to biocrude and biochar, HTL also generates wastewater which may include toxic compounds. Therefore, we not only aim at the production of high quality cost-effective biocrude but also consider the HTL wastewater biodegradability. Biological treatment can be a less expensive option than other approaches, such as activated carbon and chemical treatment. The current research includes two objectives: 1) investigate the relationship among HTL operating conditions, the biocrude yields/properties and the characteristics of HTL wastewater to predict the wastewater biodegradability by using statistical analysis; and 2) optimize the biocrude yields/properties and HTL wastewater biodegradability.The current study is focused on optimizing HTL of corn stover in the temperature range of 250 – 350 °C and reaction time of 1 – 60 min. The generated HTL wastewater will be used to cultivate three different fungal strains includingAspergillus nigerstrain NRRL 2001,Phanerochaete chrysosporiumstrain BKM-F-1767, andRhodotorula mucilaginosato evaluate the HTL wastewater biodegradability.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFast pyrolysis of agricultural residues produces a viscous liquid (bio-oil) that can serve as a precursor to renewable drop-in fuels and coproducts. While adaptation of bio-oils to a refinery serves as the ideal, the feasibility relies heavily on the oxygen content of said bio-oil. A relatively low oxygen content (< 16 wt% O) would lower both oil density and reactivity. Distillation of these bio-oils proceeds with significant yields of organic compounds. However, if oils cannot undergo distillation due to reactive instabilities, then separation methods are still desirable for further upgrading. A modified extraction method on whole oil could bypass distillation of unstable oils, which could also reduce heat duty and process costs if extraction is performed first.In the past we’ve shown that one-ring phenolics can be extracted from distillates of partially deoxygenated bio-oils (<16 wt% O), thereby producing a hydrocarbon fraction in parallel. We will discuss the use of solvent-mediated extraction of whole bio-oils, (16 - 24 wt% O) based on toluene and isopropyl alcohol. Bio-oils of varying oxygen content and quality underwent extraction with toluene. The toluene soluble fraction (TS) underwent extraction with 10M NaOH, thus producing phenolics and hydrocarbon fractions. The Toluene insoluble fraction (TI) underwent extraction with isopropyl alcohol, producing soluble and insoluble fractions (IPA-S; IPA-I). We successfully isolated hydrocarbon fractions and one-ring phenolics without distillation, with the option to further upgrade the highly oxygenated IPA-S and IPA-I fractions. Specifically, the IPA-I fraction underwent py-GCMS with and without catalyst, which showed conversion to deoxygenated gasoline and jet fuel-range compounds.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe production of both conventional and catalytic pyrolysis oils always generates a liquid fraction that has very high water content and a very low organic fraction. This aqueous phase has to be treated for disposal in any large biofuels processing facility. Several methods have been proposed for disposing of such liquids. We investigated the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of aqueous-phase pinyon-juniper catalytic pyrolysis liquid using a new multi-functional red mud-supported nickel (Ni/RM) catalyst. The organic liquid yield after HDO of the liquid using 30 wt % Ni/RM at a reaction temperature of 350 °C was 47.8 wt % with an oxygen content of 1.14 wt %. The organic liquid fraction consisted of aliphatics, aromatics, and alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons which formed two phases with the aqueous phase. After decantation the aqueous phase contained more than 99% water. This method presents an alternative method for treating of the aqueous phase while simultaneously recovering the organic fraction as hydrocarbon fuels. The RM support catalyzed ketonization of carboxylic acids. The Ni metal catalyzed partial reduction of oxygenates that underwent carbonyl alkylation with aldehydes and ketones on the RM. Catalyst deactivation assessment suggested that oxidation and coke formation were the main controlling factors for deactivation of Ni and RM, respectively. For comparison, commercial (∼65 wt %) Ni/SiO2−Al2O3 was tested in HDO experiments, which gasified the soluble organics in the aqueous phase and did not produce liquid hydrocarbons but produced mostly methane.",

    "abstract": "AbstractResearch InterestsBiochar is a carbon-rich byproduct obtained from the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass as renewable energy sources to synthesis gas and/or liquid fuel by advanced thermal methods. The content of biochar generally contains carbon (%80-85) and other elements such as nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and iron. It is possible to activate biochar by converting it into an efficient form and use it as a high porous adsorbent. The activation of biochar is achieved by increasing the surface area, number, and volume of micro-pores. Therefore, physical and/or chemical activation processes must be applied to obtain active biochar.The current inability to utilize by-product biochar as an efficient product after the transformation of biomass with advanced thermal methods is a disadvantage in many respects, given the spread of such technologies. Although by-product biochar formed after the advanced thermal transformation of lignocellulosic biomass cannot be used as an adsorbent due to its lack of high surface area, a small amount can be used as a soil regulator and is usually consumed inefficiently in combustion boilers.The dissertation titled “Production of Active Carbon from Biochar by Biomass Gasification” was examined as a doctoral study. In this study, the gasification of apricot seed and walnut shell biomass was carried out, and then a method and system were created by performing both physically and chemically the activation of the by-product biochar into activated carbon, which is a very valuable adsorbent and consumed a lot. However, studies in the literature have shown that biomass usually intended to be converted into activated carbon undergoes processes that create very high costs, making it uneconomical to apply these methods in industry on large scales.Postdoctoral research aims to integrate the method created in the doctoral dissertation into advanced biomass thermal conversion processes and produce synthesis gas and/or liquid fuel from lignocellulosic biomass by intensifying the process. In addition, it aims to produce high-porous active biochar and investigate high-porous active biochar production methods in Missouri S&T laboratories.In this study, the mass loss and surface properties of the produced activated biochar were examined. Subsequent analyses were carried out for materials that were deemed suitable for the use of activated carbon. It was analyzed with FT-IR Spectroscopy, XRF, EDS and SEM analyses were interpreted. Activated carbons, adsorption isotherms were examined depending on temperature, time and concentration. Adsorption equilibrium experimental data were investigated by examining their suitability for Langmuir and Freundlich models. Furthermore, kinetic studies on activated carbons were conducted, and calculations were made in certain models.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBackground, Aims and Scope.Biomass cracking and gasification technology, as a kind of thermochemical conversion technology, is widely used due to its advantages of strong raw material adaptability and high conversion efficiency. However, the organic pollutants produced in the biomass gasification process not only seriously affect the conversion efficiency, but also cause a certain degree of pollution to the atmospheric environment and endanger human health. These organic pollutants are condensable macromolecular gaseous organics produced during a series of complex gasification processes of biomass. Therefore, it can be considered that the organic pollutants produced in the biomass gasification process belong to the category of VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). At present, there are lots of VOCs treatment technologies, including adsorption, absorption, membrane separation, incineration, biodegradation, and catalysis. Many of these methods are prone to secondary pollution, poor stability and low removal efficiency during the treatment process, which are not conducive to the efficient elimination of VOCs. Catalytic method has high removal efficiency, does not cause secondary pollution, and is considered to be the most efficient removal method. For the VOCs produced by biomass gasification, catalytic cracking can be selected to remove them. In the method, a catalyst is added in the biomass gasification process, and the carbon-carbon bonds in the generated VOCs molecules are broken under the action of the catalyst, which reduces the activation energy of the cracking. This enables VOCs to be reformed and converted into small molecular gases at lower temperatures. This not only improves the removal efficiency of VOCs, but also further increases the yield of cracking gas. Undoubtedly, the core of catalytic cracking technology is the development of catalysts. Among various catalysts, nickel-based catalysts are the most widely used due to their low price and high activity. Active metal nickel has a certain activation effect on C-C bonds and C-H bonds in VOCs molecules, which can effectively promote the decomposition of organic macromolecules and effectively control the gas composition. The catalyst prepared with molecular sieve as carrier has large specific surface area, excellent thermal stability and special pore structure, so it has better catalytic activity for the catalytic cracking of VOCs. Previous studies have shown that HZSM-5 zeolite was considered as an ideal catalyst support due to its good surface acidity, hydrothermal stability and selectivity. Therefore, HZSM-5 molecular sieve is supported by active metal Ni, hoping to prepare a catalyst for the efficient removal of VOCs.Methods.Molecular sieves were pretreated before catalyst preparation. After grinding the solid HZSM-5 molecular sieve into 80 mesh powder, it was calcined at 600 °C for 3 h, in order to improve the mechanical strength of the molecular sieve and remove impurities. The preparation of the nickel-based catalyst was based on HZSM-5 molecular sieve as the carrier, supported metal nickel as the active component, and traditional impregnation, ultrasonic assistance, ion exchange and rotary evaporation were used as auxiliary methods. The solids obtained by different auxiliary methods were dried in an oven at 105 °C for 12 h, ground into powder and calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 3 h to obtain the prepared Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst.The performance test of the catalyst was carried out in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. The model compound was injected into the first stage reactor through a peristaltic pump, the catalyst was placed in the second stage, and the model compound was catalytically pyrolyzed under the action of the catalyst. In the whole process, high-purity N2 was used as the carrier gas, the gas product was collected by the air bag, and the liquid product was recovered after passing through the cooling system for subsequent qualitative and quantitative analysis.Results and Discussion.In this study, the prepared nickel-based supported molecular sieve catalyst was used to study the catalytic cracking of VOCs model compounds. The influence of different catalyst preparation processes and cracking conditions was investigated, and the catalytic cracking conversion paths of various VOCs model compounds were explored. The conclusions are as follows: 1) The optimal preparation method of self-made nickel-based supported catalyst was ultrasonic-assisted excess impregnation method, and the optimal loading amount of Ni was 8 wt.%. The preparation method was convenient and easy to operate. Ultrasonic assistance not only promoted the refinement of the particle size of the active components and improved the dispersion of the active components, but also effectively controlled the loading of active metals through impregnation. 2) Through the study of cracking temperature, it was found that with the increase of temperature, the conversion rate of model substances and the yield of cracking gas increased significantly, and 800 °C was selected as the cracking temperature within the temperature selection range. 3) Catalytic cracking of various types of VOCs model compounds was carried out at 800 °C using Ni/HZMS-5 catalyst, and it was found that the model compounds could be converted from macromolecular organic compounds to small molecular gases under catalysis, and the conversion rate could mostly reach more than 90%. Model compounds such as toluene, phenol, and acetic acid can generate more hydrogen by cracking. The selectivity of H2and CH4from toluene cracking reached 93%, and cyclohexane reached more than 98%.Conclusion.This study selected toluene and phenol as the representative of VOCs monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, furan as the representative of heterocyclic compounds, and cyclohexane and acetic acid as the model compounds of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The catalytic cracking experiments were carried out using a self-made nickel-based supported molecular sieve catalyst to obtain the optimal preparation conditions of the catalyst. The transformation path of catalytic cracking of different VOCs model substances was explored, aiming to provide a new idea for the removal of VOCs and the efficient utilization of biomass resources.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBackground, Aims and Scope.Aluminum dross is a hazardous solid waste that poses a severe challenge to the environment and public health. The conversion of biomass into hydrogen-rich gas is an effective way to address energy shortages and production. However, selecting suitable catalyst materials is the key to increasing the yield of hydrogen-rich gas, reducing pollutants such as tar, and determining whether hydrogen-rich gas can be successfully applied.Methods.This study begins with the problems such as low activity, high cost, poor anti-coking properties, easy coking and poisoning, and short lifespan of existing catalysts for catalyzing the conversion of biomass into high-quality hydrogen-rich gas, followed by briefly introducing the characteristics, hazards, types, composition, and sources of aluminum dross. Next, with aluminum dross as a base material, we propose to preliminary synthesize carbon-aluminum composite materials by loading active components-carbon sources onto activated aluminum dross with a hydrothermal method. The hydrothermal method is utilized to load transition metal of iron onto the surface and pores of the selected carbon-aluminum composite material to prepare a carbon-aluminum composite material-supported iron catalyst. The pore structure, surface characteristics, and thermal stability of the catalyst are all characterized. Finally, using poplar sawdust as the raw material, the thermal decomposition product yield, gas release rate and yield are investigated as the main indicators to explore the impact of the catalyst on the thermal decomposition of biomass, and to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of using aluminum dross to catalyze the conversion of biomass into hydrogen-rich gas.Results and Discussion.The results indicate that the stability of activated aluminum dross is significantly improved, obtaining a larger specific surface area and pore volume. In particular, the acetic acid-activated aluminum dross has a specific surface area of 178.4 m2/g, an average pore size of 9.40 nm, a pore volume of 0.42 cm3/g, and a thermal conductivity coefficient of 0.3151 W/mK, which has similar pore structure characteristics to alumina oxide. In the carbon-aluminum composite material, the carbon sources are combined with the metallic oxides in the aluminum dross to form C-O-M clusters through hydrogen bonds or van der Waals forces, with a specific surface area, average pore size, and pore volume of 118 m2/g, 10.3 nm, and 0.43 cm3/g, respectively. It has a well-developed pore structure and a thermal conductivity coefficient of 0.2194 W/mK, and exhibits the advantages of both activated carbon and alumina oxide as a catalyst for catalytic biomass pyrolysis and gas reforming reaction, thus can be used as an excellent catalyst carrier for catalytic biomass pyrolysis to produce hydrogen-rich gas and gas reforming reaction. The carbon-aluminum composite material further loaded with iron exhibits a strong metal-support synergistic effect on the surface. This enhances the ability of the aluminum dross to promote reforming and cracking reactions, leading to the cleavage of heavy chain volatiles into lighter molecules and gases, resulting in a higher gas yield (43.77%) and lower coke deposition (19.79%). The H2yield is significantly improved to 64.24 ml/g-biomass, providing a promising route for the pyrolysis of biomass to produce hydrogen-rich gas.Conclusion.It is feasible to recycle abandoned aluminum dross as catalyst for biomass pyrolysis to produce hydrogen-rich gas. This approach represents the reuse of waste resources and can effectively promote the efficient conversion of biomass and by-products, laying a theoretical foundation for the application of waste resources in the fields of environment, energy, and chemical industry, achieving the dual goals of protecting natural resources and obtaining economic benefits.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSupported tungsten oxides (WOx) have been studied as catalysts for a variety of reactions that involve H2, such as the reduction of carboxylic acids. The active sites for carboxylic acid reduction are influenced by the presence of H2in the feed, which can affect the speciation of the WOxclusters. Here, we used a combination of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, global optimization methods, and ab initio thermodynamic modeling to evaluate the speciation and thermodynamic stability of titania and silica supported WOxclusters.We constructed molecular models for different WOxdomain sizes (monomers, dimers, trimers) supported on titania and silica, consistent with the small WOxclusters we observed by STEM on our experimentally synthesized materials. To evaluate reactivity of the supported WOxclusters with hydrogen, we globally optimized a library of structures with variable numbers of Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites (from oxygen vacancies). Ab initio thermodynamic modeling (Figure 1) showed that WOxspeciation on TiO2forms acid sites at milder conditions than WOxon silica. Consistent with this observation, H2TPR of the synthesized materials showed that catalysts on TiO2began consuming H2at ~600 K whereas catalysts on silica showed H2consumption at ~915 K. Bader charge analyses of WOxon titania indicated that the oxidation state of W was not significantly affected by the removal of O atoms or addition of H atoms and remained close to +6. Tungsten retained its +6 state by restructuring upon oxygen-removal or delocalization of the electron for hydrogen-addition. Our results are corroborated by in-situ XPS of W, which revealed that the titania supported WOxspecies did not change from an initial oxidation state of +6 during thermal treatments in H2. However, in-situ XPS for silica supported WOxshowed that W is reduced, which is supported by Bader charge analysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIncreasing social sustainability triggers the persistent progress of industrial catalysis in energy transformation and chemical production. Zeolite catalysts are famous workhorses for most chemical industries. However, the performances of zeolite catalysts are commonly restricted by the molecular transport behaviors (diffusion) between their active sites and pore networks, which have always been overlooked.[1]Herein, we focus on revealing the structure–transport–reactivity relationship in H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts and controlling the molecular diffusion pathway to regulate their catalytic efficiencies. A homemade time-resolvedin situFTIR spectrum, directly monitoring the change in molecular concentration by detecting the intensity variation of characteristic IR bands with time, was developed to measure the diffusivities in zeolite catalysts. Employing this method, several molecular transport behaviors, i.e. surface diffusion and intracrystalline diffusion, were studied in detail. It is indicated that the surface diffusion barriers of H-ZSM-5 zeolites may have arisen from the surface silanol defect sites, such as external silanol groups or those near the pore mouths.[2]Decreasing the surface barriers can distinctly increase the catalyst lifetime without loss of the product selectivity in catalytic cracking reaction (OCC) (Figure A). Besides, the diffusion anisotropy in different channels of H-ZSM-5 zeolite was proposed as the descriptor for the morphology effect in OCC performances.[3]Controlling the intracrystalline diffusion pathway via changing the pore channel proportion could modulate the catalytic activity and stability (Figure B). Finally, the effect of binders in practical zeolite particles that are applied in industrial reactors on their molecular diffusion behaviors was preliminarily uncovered. We feel that our findings would offer mechanistic insight into the design of highly efficient zeolite catalysts.References[1] Xiaoliang Liu, Zaiku Xie* et al.Chem.Soc.

    "abstract": "AbstractIn recent years, scientists have developed a variety of synthesis approaches to control morphology and size of nanoparticles. Improving the catalytic activity of a given metal by tuning its size and controlling its shape, results in the exposure of different crystallographic orientation on the surface of the nanoparticles1,2. Ethylene epoxidation is one of the instances that highlights the importance of the shape and size of nanoparticles. Experimental research showed silver(Ag) nanowires and silver nanospheres dominantly include Ag(100) and Ag(111), respectively2. Computational studies demonstrated that Ag(100) faces have greater EO selectivity because of their lower apparent activation energy3.This work implemented the modified polyol method and wetness impregnation to synthesize silver nanowires and nanospheres supported on aluminum oxide, respectively. The EO selectivity of these catalysts was evaluated in a reactor at constant conversion and varying oxygen to ethylene ratios. EO selectivity is raised by increasing the oxygen to ethylene ratio because if involving additional types of catalytic sites. In addition, silver nanowires exhibited greater EO selectivity than silver nanospheres due to their larger concentration of (100) silver facets compared to (111). The EO selectivity was further improved by using common promoters for ethylene epoxidations, such as cesium. Adding promoters at ppm level is crucial so they do not inhibit silver's active sites.Sangaru, S.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe Strong Metal Support Interaction (SMSI) phenomena, first observed for metals supported on reducible oxides, is now seen on irreducible oxides, carbides, and borides. Although the growth of support overlayers on metal particles prevents sintering, these overlayers decrease reaction rates; since the metal active sites are passivated. Our previous study showed that noble metals exhibit SMSI phenomena on TiB2supports with the nanoparticles being sintering resistant. To understand stability-reactivity-selectivity trade-offs engendered by SMSI phenomena, we use HCOOH decomposition as a probe reaction. We build a first principles microkinetic model constructed across a library of twelve active sites: Pd(111), TiB2(0001) supports, monolayers of TiB2(0001) supported on Pd, and partially complete monolayers representing intermediate stages of SMSI. We consider both oxidized and boron-terminated support overlayers, since XPS experiments suggest surface oxidation. We then determine the transition state energies for HCOOH dehydrogenation to CO2/H2and HCOOH dehydration to CO/H2O across the library of active sites. The different binding modes of C1oxygenates on TiB2overlayers stabilizes key oxygenates like monodentate formate relative to Pd(111). The presence of monodentate formate is also confirmed using DRIFTS. TiB2overlayers, however, exhibit a 0.8 eV higher barrier for H-H recombination, the rate determining step. These competing effects result in SMSI overlayers exhibiting 106times slower catalytic turnovers for HCOOH dissociation relative to Pd(111). Partially complete overlayers however, exhibit higher rates than complete overlayers, because these structures expose coordinatively unsatured Ti sites where H-H recombination proceeds with a barrier comparable to Pd(111). Structures exhibiting SMSI phenomena have significantly higher selectivity towards dehydration (CO + H2) versus Pd sites. Using the microkinetic model, we discuss how SMSI influences kinetic metrics like apparent activation energies, rate orders, and degrees of rate control. This microkinetic study highlights the catalytic consequences of the structural evolution of a catalyst undergoing SMSI phenomena.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNumerous potential applications of heterogenous base catalysts in a variety of industrial chemical processes indicates the urgent need of development of new strategies for fabrication of highly active solid base catalysts. Herein, we report the synthesis and application of a highly nanoporous magnesium oxide (MgO) derived from a Mg-based metal-organic framework (Mg-MOF-74) through thermal treatment under static air environment at 600 °C. In fact, the evaporation of the ligands, present in the structure of MOF-74 (i.e. 2,5-dihydroxyterephtalic acid), generates nanopores inside final structure of MgO, which play a key role in its enhancement activity towards catalytic reactions. The as-made nanoporous MgO exhibited high crystallinity and accurate structural phase formation as confirmed by XRD patterns in comparison with a conventional MgO fabricated from commercial Mg(NO3)2.6H2O precursor (Fig.1). Moreover, according to the obtained results from temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analysis, the total number of active basic sites enhanced by six times in the MOF-derived MgO (595 µmolCO2/g) compared to MgO commercial (96 µmolCO2/g) whereas the nature of basic sites obtained from CO2DRIFT (Fig.2) is the same. As it can be observed, the existence of absorbance bands at around 1680 and 1480 cm-1, at 1320 and 1640 cm-1, and also at 1520 to 1540 cm-1demonstrates the presence of low-strength, medium-strength, and high-strength basic sites, respectively.Finally, the activity of produced nanoporous MgO was assessed in the Knoevenagel reaction carried out in a fixed-bed flow reactor under mild conditions (50 °C). The experimental results (Fig.3) unveiled significantly higher catalytic activity of the nanoporous MgO as it was confirmed by greater initial rate as well as smaller deactivation constants (Kd(1/h)).Based on the presented results, MOF materials can be known as promising candidates for producing highly active nanoporous solid base catalysts that can be employed in various applications in industry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDesigning oxide-supported metal catalysts for parahydrogen-induced hyperpolarization (PHIP) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging. Production of hyperpolarized molecules using parahydrogen requires pairwise addition to an unsaturated molecule. However, oxide-supported metal catalysts mediate facile and reversible dissociation of dihydrogen, rapid diffusion of hydrogen atoms across the metal surface, and step-wise addition to the unsaturated molecule, leading to the loss of singlet spin-correlation. Limiting the metal particle size can restrict hydrogen adatom diffusion but is often not sufficient to prevent randomization of the singlet spin order for highly active hydrogenation catalysts. An alternative strategy is to limit the diffusion of hydrogen by blocking sites on the metal nanoparticles with an oxide layer. We have successfully demonstrated that strong metal-support interactions can improve the pairwise selectivity over titania-supported metal catalysts. A high-temperature reduction at 773 K results in migration of a TiOxlayer (where 1.5 < x < 2.0) over the metal nanoparticles, and this has been shown to increase the pairwise selectivity in the propene hydrogenation reaction over Rh/TiO2and Ir/TiO2catalysts (compared with catalysts reduced at only 473 K). The activity (propene conversion) is higher at lower temperatures for the Rh/TiO2catalysts, but the pairwise selectivity, and thus the NMR signal enhancement, is significantly higher over the Ir/TiO2catalysts (Figures 1a and b). To gain more control over the oxide overlayer, we employed atomic layer deposition to deposit Al2O3and ZrO2over Rh/TiO2and Pt/Al2O3catalysts. As expected from the general inverse relationship between catalytic activity and selectivity, the overlayers reduce activity (conversion of propene, Figure 1c) while increasing pairwise selectivity. For in-vivo MRI, achieving pairwise selective addition by heterogeneous catalysis would offer important advantages over homogeneous hydrogenation where rapid separation from hyperpolarized adducts is problematic and catalyst stability is lacking.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSignificant efforts are underway to develop a circular economy for plastics including mechanical and chemical recycling. Catalytic routes for chemical recycling and upcycling have been proposed as possible solutions for waste management, as they have the potential to transform waste plastic into its original building blocks or higher value products.The presence of polymer additives may play an important role in the long-term activity of the catalysts used for chemical recycling processes. Zinc stearate (ZnSt) is a commonly used polyethylene additive, which works as an acid scavenger. We have observed that the presence of ZnSt in the polymer melt permanently modifies ZSM-5 used for recycling reactions. The deposited zinc on zeolite has been shown to increase activity of the catalyst, likely by increasing the hydrocarbon activation capabilities of the catalyst via facilitating dehydrogenation.However, when Zn is deposited onto mesoporous acid catalysts, we observe that there is a decrease in activity, which is an opposite trend when compared to ZSM-5. There is evidence in the literature that zeolites having larger pores (BEA) or big cavities (CHA) do not show enhanced alkane cracking conversions after exchange with zinc. On the other hand, when observing more confined zeolites, there is evidence that Zn-exchanged ZSM-22 (TON) present higher alkane cracking conversion and aromatics selectivity.In this work, we systematically study the role of confined structures for zinc atoms to form active sites, by exchanging zinc with different zeolite frameworks, both via incipient wetness impregnation and zinc-containing polyethylene decomposition (and subsequent regeneration). We also assess the effect of pre-existing paired Bronsted sites on the Zn exchange by exchanging different Si/Al ratio zeolites within the same framework structure. This work reveals the interesting role that some common polymer additives may play when in contact with catalysts often employed in polymer upcycling reactions.",

However, comprehensive electrification of the chemical industry will require electrocatalytic reactions that can promote the transformations of C(sp3)-H and C(sp3)-C(sp3) bonds, which are central to today’s industry.In this presentation, I will show how fundamental understanding of the interfacial processes occurring in electrocatalytic reactions can be exploited to expand the reaction scope of electrocatalysis to the transformation of complex substrates involving the controlled activation of C-H and C-C bonds. In a first step, I will show how this approach allows us to transform ethanol to ethylene oxide, an important plastic precursor.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe specific adsorption of anions is important in (electro)catalysis, as many anions are reactants (nitrate, formate) [1,2] or site-blocking spectators (sulfate, phosphate, acetate) [3,4] in many (electro)catalytic reactions. Their adsorption energy onto the electrode surface dictates their coverage, and therefore the activity and selectivity of these reactions. Using a combination of density functional theory computational modeling and detailed experiments on well-defined single-crystal electrodes, we have identified a molecular property of anions that is linearly correlated to their adsorption energies (at least across a set of structurally similar anions). We can therefore use this property as a descriptor to predict their adsorption energetics. We additionally used experiments on both single-crystal and polycrystalline platinum electrodes to understand the mechanism of glycolic acid oxidation, finding that the adsorbed glycolate anion is a reactive intermediate. By investigating the role of glycolate/glycolic-acid concentration and electrolyte pH, we find changing (and sometimes negative) reaction orders, which can be explained by a rate determining step which involves both adsorbed glycolate and adsorbed hydroxide, at least on Pt(111). While glycolic acid electrocatalytic oxidation could be industrially relevant, in (waste)water treatment or in glycolic acid fuel cells, the rate of this reaction on platinum is quite low. Therefore, we will instead discuss how a mechanistic understanding of glycolate oxidation can be used to help us understand that of other small molecules, such as methanol, ethylene glycol, and formic acid (which are kinetically faster but more complex).J.-X.

    "abstract": "AbstractIridium oxide (IrO2), a prototypical electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), operates via inner-sphere processes that are highly sensitive to the composition and structure of the oxide-water interface. One fundamental characteristic of oxide surfaces that controls the surface composition and effective surface charge is the point of zero charge (pHPZC). Experimentally, this can be used as a tuning knob to optimize the OER kinetics through, e.g. the appropriate selection of electrolytes and/or surface modification of the electrocatalyst. However, central to the atomistic design of the oxide electrocatalyst, is the estimation of the acid dissociation constants (pKa) of the different surface sites, which are directly related to the pHPZCbut still not accessible using current experimental techniques. Computationally, their estimation has also been limited by the length and time scales accessible throughab-initiomolecular dynamics simulations (AIMD).In this presentation, I will discuss our approach on using a deep neural network potential, trained on accurate first-principles data to represent the potential energy surface of the rutile IrO2(110)-water interface. We use this to provide fundamental and hitherto unreported insights on the hydration structure, water dissociation fraction, and proton transfer mechanisms by performing long (nanosecond) timescale deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations of the interface. Subsequently, we combine DPMD with enhanced sampling methods to perform an efficient exploration of the free-energy surface of the acid-base reactions and obtain quantitative estimates of the pKaof the different surface sites and the pHPZC, found to be in very good agreement with experiments.",

There is considerable evidence that the outstanding performance of SACs arises from a drastic modification of the electronic environment on the catalyst surface to bring in the new chemistry. To understand the structure-function relationships of metal oxide-supported Pt catalysts, especially to study the electronic feature and catalytic performance of sub-nanometer-sized Pt sites that have small atom numbers, we adjusted the geometry of Pt supported on Fe3O4changing from single-atoms to rafts to nanoparticles gradually. The functionality and stability of the above-mentioned Pt geometries are tested on two different reactions: the reduction of CO2and the aldol condensation of acetone. Reactivities of CO2reduction and acetone aldol condensation were found to follow different trends in the presented structures. In the reaction of CO2reduction, the raft catalysts demonstrate the same turn-over-frequency (TOF) but significantly improved stability compared to the single atoms. In addition, the nuclearity of the Pt structures is found to be crucial in determining the phase transition and involvement of the Fe3O4support in the CO2reduction. On the other side, the raft and nanoparticle catalysts cannot compete with the single atoms regarding the activity in the aldol-condensation reaction. A series of prevailing characterizations were performed on the synthesized Pt structures, and the results underline our hypothesis that doping Pt single atoms to the surface of Fe3O4creates stronger Ptδ+-O2-pairs facilitating the acetone adsorption and α-H abstraction steps, which eventually results in the remarkable high activity of the Pt SAC in the self-coupling of acetone.",

Among them are zeolites with varying confinement and topology, and polyoxometalates with varying acid strength. Methanol dehydration can occur via two competing mechanisms, a concerted (associative) or sequential (dissociative), where the former forms DME in a single bimolecular reaction, while the latter forms DME via a surface-bound methyl (Z–CH3) intermediate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that methanol dehydrates via the concerted route at typical reaction conditions (< 450 K, >0.3 kPa CH3OH). Here, we perform DFT calculations to revisit the methanol dehydration reaction by systematically varying functional (electronic) groups from –OH in methanol to –NH2, –PH2, –SH, –F, and –Cl in methylamine, methyl phosphine, methanethiol, methyl fluoride, and methyl chloride, respectively, to fundamentally address if the conclusions from methanol dehydration about Brønsted acid catalysts are extendible to other probe molecules. Specifically, we revisit the role of zeolite topology and confinement effects by contrasting CHA and MFI zeolite frameworks to a 2D surface model of a zeolite, and we revisit the role of acid strength in Keggin type WO3polyoxometalates (POMs) by varying the metal heteroatom identity (Al, Si, P, and S). While we have examined all three steps involved in methanol dehydration (surface methylation, methanol methylation, and concerted DME formation), here we present exemplar data on surface methylation by the CH3XHnseries that indicate the most facile surface methylations occur with CH3NH2donors, followed by CH3OH, CH3SH, CH3PH2, CH3Cl, and the weakest methyl donor being CH3F. While proton affinities describe differences between functional groups, reaction energies suggest that confinement and acid strength alters probe molecule behavior to different extents. This, in turn, motivates revisiting further conclusions derived from probe reaction chemistry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMethane dehydroaromatization (DHA) can be facilitated by molybdenum supported on MFI zeolites (Mo-MFI) with high aromatics selectivity (~80%) [1]. Carbonaceous deposits formed during reaction leads to rapid deactivation, which can be removed by O2at relatively high-temperatures (>823 K), but causes structural changes on Mo-MFI leading to irreversible decreases of initial rates with increasing numbers of reaction-regeneration cycles [2,3]. Here, we use a variety of characterization techniques, including H2TPR, NH3TPD,27Al NMR andin situXAS coupled with kinetic measurements to elucidate the structural changes to Mo sites and H+sites on Mo-MFI during successive cycles of reaction-regeneration. Catalysts were prepared by MoO3deposition on commercial MFI zeolites (Si/Al ~12), followed by oxidative treatments (823 K) to transform MoO3into ion-exchanged Mo species. Forward DHA rates (950 K, 60 CH4kPa) were measured using Mo-MFI and decrease systematically with increasing numbers of reaction and regeneration (20 O2kPa) cycles. We show that residual H+sites decrease upon exposure to hydrothermal degradation conditions during regeneration because of framework dealumination, and consequently results in the decrease of the fraction of ion-exchanged Mo species, which are the active site precursors for methane DHA. Concurrently, the loss of H+sites on the zeolite support leads to Mo transformation to aluminum molybdate domains during regeneration, as evidenced by27Al NMR; these Mo species do not carburize under reaction conditions and are inactive for methane DHA. Moreover, we developed a regeneration protocol that allows extending the catalyst lifetime, and synthetic methods using non-commercial zeolites to improve the catalyst stability. This work demonstrates the use of characterization and kinetic measurements to elucidate the fundamental causes of Mo-MFI catalyst deactivation and how such insights provide guidance to developing synthetic and regeneration strategies to extend catalyst lifetime for methane DHA reaction-regeneration cycles.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCO2hydrogenation catalyzed by transition metals can yield C1products (e.g., CH4, CH3OH, CO) at relatively mild conditions (473-673 K, 1-10 bar). CH3OH and CH4often form in parallel with CO, motivating questions about catalytic structure-function relationships that drive reactivity and selectivity.1,2This work provides mechanistic insights into CO2hydrogenation routes (Fig. 1a), through a systematic comparison of the activity of low-index surfaces (Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ru), using density functional theory (DFT; PBE-D3) calculations and microkinetic models. DFT results indicate that oxophilic transition metals (Co, Ni, Rh, and Ru) activate CO2via direct dissociation, while less oxophilic metals (Pd and Pt) require hydrogen assistance. Selectivity between CO, CH4, and CH3OH is driven by preferences for CO desorption, hydrogenation, and C-O bond dissociation. Two C-O bond dissociation steps are required to form CH4, whereas only one is required for CH3OH or CO. The kinetic preference for dissociation v. hydrogenation is reflected in rate constant ratios (kC-O:kH-add) for CO*-derived species (Fig. 1b). C-O bond dissociation is kinetically challenging on Pd and Pt, as indicated by kC-O:kH-add< 1, but favorable on Co, Ni, Rh, and Ru after two hydrogenations of CO*. Microkinetic modelling indicates that CH4forms via a kinetically relevant C-O bond dissociation step on Co, Ni, Rh, and Ru; Pd and Pt favor CO production, through carboxylate dissociation and CO* desorption. The comprehensive data set offered herein permits facile comparisons across transition-metal surfaces for C1reactions, providing insight on the fundamental nature of their active sites and key steps that control product selectivity.

    "abstract": "AbstractFunctionalization of polyolefin backbones can greatly enhance their value and versatility but remains a challenging prospect due to their chemical resistance arising from inert C–H bonds. Recent studies have demonstrated that a homogeneous Ru catalyst can selectively oxidize polyethylene, while an analogous Fe catalyst exhibited no catalytic activity. Yet, selective Fe-based C–H activation catalysts are ubiquitous not only in the chemical space of metalloenzymes but also synthetic catalysts. In this work, we perform a high-throughput virtual screening of Ru and Fe complexes using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to unearth the differences in their C–H activation reactivity, focusing on the roles of spin and oxidation state. We perform calculations on C–H activation intermediates for a large and diverse catalyst design space of mononuclear Ru and Fe complexes comprising realistic tetradentate macrocyclic ligands as well as combinations of small monodentate ligands that span ligand field strengths and coordinating atom identities. Our DFT calculations reveal that closed shell Fe and Ru complexes show tighter metal-oxo formation vs. hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) scaling relation with the oxo formation and HAT energies for both metals lying close to parity. For open shell complexes, we see more opportunity to break this scaling relation. Furthermore, we observe greater oxo formation favorability and HAT unfavorability in Ru complexes compared to Fe complexes. Nonetheless, Fe systems exhibit oxo formation energies within favorable ranges with a much lower upper bound on HAT. We find that these differences in reaction energetics at higher spin states can be attributed to C–H activation proceeding through spin forbidden pathways on Ru complexes compared to spin allowed pathways on Fe complexes. Thus, our broad catalyst screening efforts uncover the potential of the more earth-abundant Fe-based catalysts for polyolefin functionalization.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe Boudouard reaction – the reaction of 2 carbon monoxide (CO) molecules to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and elemental carbon (C) – is an important chemistry that can impact chemical conversion processes involving CO, the main constituent of syngas. Carbon deposition in particular can serve as a virtue or vice: uncontrolled C-deposition causes metal dusting that embrittles metal reactors and cokes catalysts leading to deactivation, while controlled deposition may serve as a means to sequester solid carbon and synthesize functional carbon nanomaterials. Early transition metals such as iron (Fe) are known to catalyze the Boudouard reaction, however systematic kinetic investigations and mechanistic insights are lacking.Through continuous plug flow reactor experiments conducted under conditions of strict kinetic control coupled with materials characterization we report on the mechanism and dynamic structural evolution of Fe catalyst species for the Boudouard reaction. XRD characterization shows that metallic Fe is rapidly converted to a bulk iron carbide (Fe3C) phase under reaction conditions. At low temperatures (T < 450°C), the Fe catalyst is stable and can sustain C-deposition to C:Fe molar ratios of > 45. At higher temperatures (T > 450°C), the catalyst exhibits dynamic time dependent reactivity consisting of initial increases in rate followed by a gradual decline that ultimately results in a fully deactivated catalyst. TEM shows that the temporal evolution is aligned with periods of surface carbon nucleation, filament growth, and finally encapsulation. Kinetic measurements in these two regimes are consistent with CO dissociation being kinetically relevant (rate-limiting) at low temperatures and mass transport of carbon diffusion through the catalyst particle being rate limiting at high temperatures.These findings suggest a balance between controlled carbon nucleation and catalyst longevity and provide important insights into the rates, mechanisms, and Fe catalyst evolution, which may be useful in the design of hydrocarbon conversion chemistries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMethanol decomposition stands as an attractive chemistry given the possibility of using methanol as a source of hydrogen. Methanol at temperatures over 200 ºC and partial pressures over 10 kPa (in the presence of a metal catalyst) decomposes to carbon monoxide and hydrogen. We also see the hydrogenation of CO to CH4as well as the water-gas shift reaction (Figure 1) at these conditions. Through experimental and computational techniques, decomposition kinetics have been widely studied across different catalytic systems. However, the trend in this chemistry over the different supported catalysts is not documented from an experimental point of view. Our study aims to comprehensively investigate methanol decomposition over silica-supported metal catalysts. Some of the catalysts we investigate include Platinum, Palladium, Ruthenium, Copper, and Iridium supported on silica. We fabricate the Silica supported catalysts by using incipient wetness impregnation methods by using salts of metals. We use Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to characterize the nanoparticle size of these formulated catalysts. This gives us the dispersion of the synthesized catalysts which helps us quantify the catalytically active sites. To quantitatively judge the trends for methanol decomposition, we plot the initial rates for the formation of carbon monoxide against the binding energies of carbon and oxygen over different catalysts to get a volcano plot. We compare these values to those reported in computational literature. The investigation serves as an experimental benchmark for further explorations of methanol decompositions over different catalytic systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAtomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) reduce the cost of expensive noble metal utilization by delivering high selectivity and per-atom activity. Single atoms can attach to different locations on the surface where they exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties. These binding sites are sensitive to the reaction conditions and can dynamically change during a chemical reaction. Such phenomena are essential in understanding how reactions proceed over ADCs. In order to discover the effects of site distribution and the dynamic character of ADCs, we use density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and (modified) energy span analysis. Recently, we thoroughly analyzed low-temperature CO oxidation pathways over the Pt1/rutile-TiO2(110) catalyst and proposed twelve distinct mechanisms. Using AIMD, we assess the stability of all intermediates that occur during reactions and revisit the proposed reaction pathways. Although most intermediates are stable at the reaction conditions, the remaining can significantly change the reaction rate if that intermediate is associated with the rate-limiting step. Additionally, we expand our study to incorporate more Pt binding sites, including anionic and cationic vacancies and two stoichiometric sites. A significant impact of local coordination on the reaction kinetics is observed. The stoichiometric site with an O-Pt-O linear complex delivers the highest turnover frequency due to the ease of removing lattice oxygen. Our comprehensive study on reaction pathways highlights the importance of combining static, kinetic, and dynamic models to identify the reaction mechanisms. A complete atomic-level picture of ADCs can only be captured using these methods, along with the distribution of co-existing single-atom sites on the surface. Moving forward, we investigate PtO2on the TiO2surface. Such structures are a great avenue for ADCs since they are active for CO oxidation and have been shown to exist in mildly reducing conditions*.*DeRitaet al., Nat. Mater.,2019, 18, 746–751.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWe investigate the use of structured catalytic monoliths coated with Al2O3-supported Pt-Pd and mixed metal oxide spinel for coupled CH4oxidation and NOx reduction. A series of dual-layer monoliths containing Pt-Pd/Al2O3(PGM) and Mn0.5Fe2.5O4/Al2O3spinel (MFO) show that a combination of a lean/rich modulation and spinel addition gives enhanced methane conversion compared to a steady state feed with the same composition. Up to a 100 °C decrease in the methane conversion light-off temperature is obtained for an application-relevant feed (CH4+ NO + H2+ CO + O2+ H2O + CO2).Flow reactor and kinetics studies were conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for enhanced CH4and NOx conversion. The data show shows enhanced CH4conversion on Pt-Pd/Al2O3+ Mn0.5Fe2.5O4/Al2O3dual layer catalyst compared to Pt-Pd/Al2O3single layer catalyst, during feed modulation over a range of amplitudes and frequencies and temperatures. The mechanism is linked to suppression of O2inhibition on the methane oxidation rate near the stoichiometric neutral point. The methane oxidation rate dependence on O2partial pressure reveals a rate maximum separating O2adsorption limited and O2inhibition regimes, along with multiplicity for a finite range of O2concentration. Feed modulation between the two regimes leads to an enhanced oxidation rate. The addition of the spinel to Pt-Pd significantly enhances CH4conversion, with the existence of an optimal modulation frequency that depends on temperature.A monolith reactor model is developed that contains independently measured kinetics of methane oxidation, methane steam reforming, and oxygen uptake and release. The model confirms our working hypothesis that the role of spinel is critical in providing efficient oxidation of partial oxidation products CO and H2which inhibit anaerobic CH4reaction with H2O.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) has gained increasing attention as an alternative method for producing ethylene from ethane. Despite various reactor designs that have been proposed in the literature for implementing ODHE, the impact of external and internal transport effects using large catalyst particles at an industrial scale have not been discussed thus far. Due to the high adiabatic temperature rise values associated with this system, ignition can occur at the particle level for larger catalyst particles (≥1 mm size) rather than merely at the bed level in the pseudo-homogeneous limit. In this work, we use a cell model with finite-size eggshell type catalyst particles (Figure 1b) to present a comprehensive ignition-extinction analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) in an adiabatic shallow-bed reactor.Our results reveal that external mass transfer can increase the ratio of ethane to oxygen on the catalyst surface (Figure 1c), thereby improving ethylene selectivity but decreasing ethane conversion (at a fixed space time). We show that diffusion limitations in the catalyst reduce ethylene selectivity and shrink the region of multiplicity, highlighting the need for eggshell particles containing a thin active layer. We also examine the impact of ethane to oxygen ratio, feed dilution, space time, catalyst particle size, operating pressure, and active layer thickness on ignition and extinction behavior. A multi-layered bed with eggshell catalyst particles (Figure 1a) is proposed for near complete conversion of oxygen, enhanced ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity. Our results indicate the possibility of autothermal operation of the ODHE process with 20%+ per pass conversion of ethane (without dilution) and 90%+ selectivity to ethylene.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMembrane steam refomers are interesting devices for the decentralized production of hydrogen as they allow the integrated production and separation of hydrogen as well as the possibility of lowering the operating temperature compared to conventional reforming processes. It has been previously shown that the performance of these devices may suffer from permeance inhibition of the hydrogen-selective membrane by the competitive adsorption of CO, one of the reaction of the products. Here, we show that that such inhibition may also lead to steady-state multiplicity. This has been attributed to the fact that, in the presence of inhibition, the mechanism limiting the performance of the reactor may shift from chemical reactions to hydrogen permeation, depending on the initial gas composition. The region of multistability depends, among other factors, on the feed composition. More specifically, it has been shown that the presence of multistability is more pronounced when feeding biogas than it is when feeding methane to the system. The findings of this work provide valuable information regarding (i) the startup procedure of the reactor that favors operating in regions of enhanced reactor peformance, (ii) procedures for carrying out a diagnosis of membrane permeance inhibition by competitive adsorption that do not require the interruption of reactor operation, and (iii) guidelines for the choice of the most appropriate membrane depending on the selected operating conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMultiscale modeling attracted considerable research interest in reaction engineering within the last years due to its outstanding abilities in analyzing reactor systems. The combination of chemical reactions with high-resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can give detailed insights into phenomena within catalytic reactors, essential for the optimization of catalytic processes.Such multiscale simulations, however, are very complex. The employed models and reaction kinetics make proper validation all the more indispensable. So how do we achieve an appropriate validation? By now, integral as well as local methods are state-of-the-art. This includes measurements of gas compositions downstream of the reactor, through a capillary in the catalytic bed or temperature measurements using thermocouples. Apart from being invasive, these methods also do not represent the three-dimensional nature of CFD.To fill this gap, the usage of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising approach. It gives scientist the possibility to measure 3D fields of velocity, temperature or species concentration within a non-transparent geometry. We already showed the feasibility of cross-validation between three-dimensional, gas-phase Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry (MRV) measurements and CFD simulations in an Open Cell Foam reactor. As a next step, the cross-validation of a reactive setup is aimed. In last years AIChE Annual Meeting, we proposed a new, additively manufactured reactor design to measure both temperature and species concentration in the heterogeneously catalyzed ethylene hydrogenation reaction.Here, we show first results of the cross-validation of reactive CFD and MRI measurements. To show the general applicability, a simple plate geometry coated with a Pt/Al2O3slurry is both measured using MRI as well as simulated using the OpenFOAM add-on DUO. These results shall be used to assess the opportunities of the combination of CFD and MRI to gain deeper insights into processes within catalytic reactors, the basis for further optimizations of reactor setups.",

Published examples of these problems and their difficulties can be found in works by [1, 2].A recent alternative method to these modeling approaches is to simultaneously obtain the reactionkinetic parameters with the curve resolution. Building on a nonlinear programming framework, thepostulated reaction model is considered in the constraints of the optimization problem while alsotaking into account noise associated with instrument and model error. To further aid practition-ers with the rapid advancement of spectral analysis methods, an optimization modeling platformcalled KIPET was introduced (KInetic Parameter Estimation Tool.The KIPET approachis derived from maximum likelihood principles and uses nonlinear programming techniques andcollocation methods to simultaneously solve a proposed reaction system, which has been shownto outperform traditional approaches like MCR-ALS.In this work, we use a simultaneous solution strategy to investigate a relevant industrial silanolreaction.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is ubiquitous to aqueous electrochemistry and is often a significant competing reaction that limits the selectivity for desired products. Due to the low onset potentials and numerous proton sources available in aqueous electrochemistry, the range of potentials and reaction rates for many reduction reactions is limited to maintain desirable selectivity. Mass transport effects and contributions of homogeneous buffer reactions can further complicate control over HER selectivity. While bulk properties can be measured, the effect of buffer reactions and hydrodynamics on the region near the electrode surface is difficult to probe experimentally. Alternatively, well parameterized multiscale models can be used to understand how the local environment at the electrode surface can be influenced to control selectivity for HER.Building on our previous work that successfully captures the hydrodynamics in the rotating cylinder electrode reactor (RCE) [1], we have developed a computational fluid dynamics simulation that captures the experimental behavior of HER in the RCE along with the influence of homogeneous buffer reactions and hydrodynamics. Special considerations in simulating the effects of electrochemical HER with the hydrodynamics and buffer reactions will be discussed along with limitations and challenges associated with accurately simulating the combination of these effects. Results will be discussed in the context of the insights they provide for controlling the local environment at the electrode surface and how the pKa values of the buffer affects the onset of contribution to HER currents on metal electrodes. Finally, the suitability of the RCE for investigating electrochemical reactions will be critically evaluated.References:Richard, D., Tom, M., Jang, J., Yun, S., Christofides, P., Morales-Guio, C., \"Quantifying transport and electrocatalytic reaction processes in a gastight rotating cylinder electrode reactor via integration of Computational Fluid Dynamics modeling and experiments,\"Electrochimica Acta,440, 141698, 2023.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe utilization of renewable biomass resources as a substitute for dwindling petroleum resources and addressing the issue of global warming has become increasingly important. One potential product of interest derived from biomass is 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) due to its high value and growing market. 5-HMF can be synthesized using acidic catalysts in various solvents from agricultural byproducts like lignin, cellulose, fructose, and glucose. Although DMSO has been preferred in a monophasic system for producing 5-HMF from fructose, its high boiling point poses a challenge in recovering the product through distillation. This challenge is exacerbated by the reactive nature of 5-HMF, which leads to low purity. To address this limitation, biphasic systems using mineral acids or ion exchange resins as catalysts have been explored. However, mineral and metallic acids have safety hazards and can cause corrosion, while ion exchange resin is susceptible to heat-induced deformation that can obstruct the reactor during the reaction, making it difficult to handle at temperatures above 110oC. This study examines various types of biphasic solvents over the heterogeneous acid catalyst, Al-MCM-41-SO4, to develop an efficient continuous process for 5-HMF production with high yield and selectivity. The study's novelty is the use of an Al-MCM41-SO4 catalyst in a continuous biphasic flow reactor system, with a specific focus on recovering 5-HMF and recycling the solvent. The research findings could lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable methods for producing valuable chemicals and fuels using renewable biomass resources.",

The main component of red mud is hematite, hence the name red mud. This work aims to provide an experimental proof-of-concept of using red mud as an oxygen carrier and catalyst in biomass gasification and evaluate the suitability of this process as a reduction roasting methodology for iron recovery. A 5 g sample was reacted with methane in a bench-scale packed bed reactor. The reactor temperature was raised to 800 °C and then held isothermal for 30 min. Exhaust gases were analyzed using a gas chromatograph. The attached figure shows the XRD diffraction pattern of red mud samples before and after the methane experiment. The iron content in the red mud was reduced from hematite (Fe2O3; 31%) and perovskite (CaFeO3, 7%) to metallic iron (Fe; 12.1%) and cohenite (Fe3C; 45.5%). The formation of CO was verified through GC analysis, which indicates that Red mud can work as an oxygen carrier. We plan to perform three experiments using: a) biomass; b) a mixture of biomass and red mud; and c) biomass and red mud separated by glass wool. Experimental and analysis conditions will be the same as in the methane experiment, but with a water vapor-saturated nitrogen stream.

    "abstract": "AbstractBiomass pyrolysis like wood is a potential strategy for converting abundant, renewable resources into a liquid fuel and chemical precursor called bio-oil. In the absence of a catalyst or hydrogen co-feed, the resulting bio-oil typically contains up to 50wt% oxygen atoms, and is highly corrosive and thermally unstable; together, these qualities make non-catalytically-produced bio-oil unusable as a liquid fuel, and difficult to upgrade using conventional refining technologies. Catalysts such as zeolites or hydrodeoxygenation-active materials can be utilized to effect partial oxygen removal during the initial biomass conversion step via dehydration and/or hydrodeoxygenation reactions, resulting in bio-oils with improved properties that are more readily upgraded into finished products using conventional refinery infrastructure. However, alkali and alkaline earth metal contaminants entrained in natural biomass resources quickly deactivate conventional catalysts; this dynamic has prevented catalytic biomass pyrolysis technologies from being meaningfully scaled-up. In this work, we report a novel series of catalyst formulations comprising dealuminated zeolites decorated with transition-metal phosphides. The dealuminated zeolites contain silanol nests which retain partial Bronsted acidity vs. their parent aluminosilicates, so that acid-catalyzed dehydration reactions of the oxygenated biomass molecules are still enabled, though entrained alkali and alkaline earth metal poisons are bound to Bronsted sites more weakly. The transition metal phosphide sites, together with a hydrogen co-feed, facilitate further deoxygenation of the biomass-derived molecules via hydrodeoxygenation reactions. Importantly, the dealuminated zeolites and transition metal phosphides are hydrothermally stable at low pH, allowing for regeneration of the catalysts via leaching of the basic metal poisons in concentrated nitric acid. Together, these characteristics represent a new family of biomass conversion catalysts which resist deactivation by the high concentrations (~ wt%) of catalyst poisons entrained in biomass, while allowing for regeneration of reuse of the catalysts and the recovery of valuable biomass nutrients in the form of metal nitrate fertilizers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBio-oil and pyrolysis gas (py-gas) are two major energy products generated from pyrolysis. Bio-oil is typically corrosive and is a challenge to combust in standard equipment while py-gas is more readily usable for energy recovery. Therefore, biochar was assessed as a cost-efficient catalyst to reduce bio-oil production and increase py-gas production. Biochars derived from six industrial carbonaceous wastes were evaluated for the first time in terms of their catalytic abilities during pyrolysis. Paper mill sludge (p-sludge) biochar was the optimal catalyst based on its high py-gas production and py-gas energy, low catalyst loading, and long catalyst life. The p-sludge biochar catalyst approximately doubled py-gas yield compared to the control test. In addition, p-sludge biochar significantly decreased bio-oil yield (e.g. reduced by 40% at 800°C) and improved bio-oil quality by decomposing heavy hydrocarbons. The bio-oil catalyzed by p-sludge biochar contained fewer organic constituents based on GC-MS and GC-FID analyses. The catalytic activity of p-sludge biochar was stable and the majority of energy inherent to the products shifted from bio-oil to py-gas over four cycles of catalyst use. The p-sludge biochar had a high calcium content (39% dry weight basis of 800°C biochar) which likely played an important role in upgrading pyrolysis products.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe isomerization reaction of glucose to fructose is an economically desirable step in the production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from fructose. As HMF is a valuable platform chemical for various industrial applications, including the production of bioplastics and biofuels, the use of cheaper glucose offers a potentially cheaper pathway that is of great benefit to the end uses of HMF. To this end, previous work has demonstrated that the functionalization of amine-based catalysts on SBA-15 mesoporous silica supports can produce fructose from glucose. Further, a general case of the glucose isomerization reaction with these materials has demonstrated that the level of microporosity present within the support structure significantly impacts catalytic performance. Many studies synthesize SBA-15 at a temperature of 100°C or less, creating a primarily mesoporous structure connected by a network of micropores. Made in this way, micropores within this support, called REG (regular)-SBA-15, do not contain active sites and present inefficiencies in material design. By contrast, a synthesis temperature of 130°C produces NMP (negligible micropore)-SBA-15, which contains substantially fewer micropores. In a general case of the glucose isomerization reaction, NMP-SBA-15 was shown to ourperform REG-SBA-15 almost threefold.However, the specific details of the application of NMP-SBA-15 to isomerization of glucose are not fully understood. Preliminary results indicate that tertiary amines placed at high loading on SBA-15 lead to higher rates of conversion, and that selectivity is positively influenced by initial concentration of glucose. As these ideas have not been fully applied to NMP materials, it has become necessary to do so. Here, tertiary amines on both NMP- and REG-SBA-15 will be tested across a range of surface loadings and initial glucose concentrations to determine the optimal reaction conditions for each and to deepen understanding of the effect of micropore content and the differences offered by NMP-SBA-15 supports.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPhenol is one of the important platform chemicals used to produce valuable chemicals and intermediates such as cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. These chemicals are used as solvents and as starting materials for manufacturing nylon and esters. Production of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol from biomass derived phenol is a promising alternative to conventional route that uses petroleum-derived benzene and is limited by formation of undesired byproducts and low yield for cyclohexanone. Selective phenol hydrogenation to cyclohexanone is of particular interest as at higher catalytic activity, further hydrogenation of cyclohexanone can lead to cyclohexanol formation and low cyclohexanone yield. The presence of basic sites on the support has shown to improve the catalytic activity of phenol hydrogenation and its selectivity to cyclohexanone. Thus, in this research we have developed palladium (Pd) catalysts for aqueous phase hydrogenation of phenol using an organic-inorganic hybrid (OIH) silica support modified by incorporation of basic sites. The organic silica support is synthesized using a sol gel method from a organometallic precursor, bis (trimethoxy silyl ethyl) benzene. This material offers a substantial advantage in incorporating functional entities on the catalyst support with simple modifications in the synthesis process. The basic sites were incorporated using bis[(3-trimethoxysilyl)propyl]amine (BTMSPA) as a co-precursor along with BTEB. Incorporating basic sites on the support showed increased selectivity to cyclohexanone because of its effect on adsorption of phenol, desorption of cyclohexanone and metal-support interaction. The effect of different methods of incorporating basic sites, during the support synthesis and post synthesis, was also studied. Pd catalysts and the supports were characterized by N2physisorption, Infrared Spectroscopy, Temperature programmed desorption, pulse CO chemisorption,transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), equilibrium adsorption experiments, elemental analysis and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractZeolite catalysts are solid nanoporous acids comprised of corner-sharing SiO4and AlO4tetrahedra, and are widely used in petroleum refining and chemical manufacturing processes. Zeolites have also been found effective in aqueous processes, including biomass processing, which has the potential to be a renewable fuel source. While other catalysts deactivate quickly in the presence of biomass, the tunable shape-selectivity of zeolites could be utilized to design them specifically for biomass feeds. One of the key challenges of utilizing zeolites in biorefining is understanding and improving their hydrothermal stability, as hot liquid water is known to degrade the zeolite’s crystalline framework. Considerable study has been done on the stability of zeolites in the presence of steam, and even in the presence of condensed water at temperatures from 100°C to 200°C, but it has generally been presumed that the zeolite framework is stable in ambient temperature liquid water. While widely accepted, this is not necessarily the case; in fact, solid-state NMR characterization of H-Y which has been soaked in deionized water at ambient temperature and pressure shows substantial framework degradation, even after only 1 hour in water. This aqueous instability may shed new light on the mechanisms of framework degradation and nature of zeolite stability in aqueous processes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDuring biodiesel production, a huge quantity of glycerol is produced as a byproduct. To utilize effectively the surplus glycerol, it is essential to convert glycerol to value-added product. The use of microwave (MW) assisted chemistry shows the effects such as short reaction times, clean and improved product yields, and less waste generation. Glycerol acetalization is an acid-catalyzed reaction of glycerol with aldehyde or ketone. In the present work, MW energy has been used for solketal synthesis using modified sulfated zirconia (Zr-S-400, Zr600-S-400, and Zr600-S-600) as a catalyst. To improve the surface area, pore diameter, and acidity of the catalyst, pre and post-thermal treatment was imparted to sulfated zirconia. Catalysts were characterized by BET, FTIR, SEM, and XRD techniques. To maximize the conversion of glycerol reaction temperature (40-56C), the concentration of doped (Mn & Ni) and un-doped catalyst, the acidity of the catalyst (0.5-1M) was optimized (at a constant microwave power of 250W) by Box-Behnken design (BBD) using Design-Expert Version 11 (Stat-Ease, Inc. Minneapolis). Reaction mixture was analyzed by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and confirmed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrophotometer (GCMS). At optimized conditions, maximum conversion (93%) was obtained with Zr-S-400 (surface are:13.25 m2/g) catalyst though it had a lesser surface area compared to Zr600-S-600 (surface area:18.81 m2/g). FTIR results indicated that post-thermal treatment of the catalyst (Zr600-S-400, and Zr600-S-600) at a higher temperature (600°C) showed the decomposition of zirconium sulfate, which might have reduced the activity of the catalyst and resulted lower conversion. Scale-up of the laboratory experiments with the utilization of MW as a CSTR was also performed. From model equations, it was found that with time volumetric flow rate should be increased to control the reactor volume. Maximum value obtained122.45 at the rate constant value (113 min-1) and 93.26% conversion was achieved for this case.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLubricants are an essential part of modern society with an over $146 billion market, but they have a significant environmental footprint. Bio lubricant base oils offer performance advantages over existing oils and mitigate environmental challenges. Recently, our center developed a strategy to synthesize performance-advantaged branched lubricant base oils from 12-tricosanone, obtained from bioderived fatty acid, and furfural, obtained from lignocellulosic biomass. The base oil has unmatched properties. Our approach serves as a potential stepping-stone to replace petroleum-derived base oils and, in turn, reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The synthesis of these novel bio-based branched lubricant base-oils involve two-steps, aldol condensation of furfural with 12-tricosanone followed by the hydrodeoxygenation reaction. A significant amount of data was presented in our publication. Towards scaling up the technology, the synthesis of the reactant 12-tricosanone from lauric acid has been achieved in excellent yields over a MgO catalyst. However, the developed synthesis method has limitations of long processing times, use of high boiling point solvent and these batch reactors cannot be easily scaled up. In the current work, we de-bottleneck this process by eliminating the solvent, shifting to a continuous flow reactor, and scaling up the process to kilogram scale production of 12-tricosanone with excellent selectivity. We also explore the economic and environmental impact of this process intensification through TEA and LCA simulations. The TEA results showed that these lubricant base-oils have less minimum selling price compared to the petroleum derived lubricants, paving the way for large-scale production of these bio-base oils.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInterfacial polyamidation, used widely in the manufacture of thin film composite membranes, is a reaction between two highly reactive monomers dissolved in mutually immiscible phases. The reaction takes place on the organic side of the interface, so the aqueous phase monomer has to diffuse through the film in order to react. The reaction involves a complex array of rate and equilibrium processes and the controlling rate can have a significant influence on film properties.\\Dhumal{2009} showed, for the polyurea system, that the regime can shift during the reaction, and the final film formed has proportions formed under the dominance different rate process. In the polyamide system considered here, account has to be taken of the byproduct HCl and its effect on the course of reaction [2]. We show that an effectiveness factor ψ and a diffusion-reaction parameter, leads to a relationship similar to the well known one for the case of diffusion with first order reaction. ψ is the ratio of actual rate and maximum reaction rate and P is ratio of transport resistance and reaction resistance.Figure 1 shows the effect of P on Ψ on log-log co-ordinates for a large number of combinations of the model parameters, along with the result for diffusion-with-first order reaction. This plot allows us to identify the controlling regimes during reaction as P changes. We have further studied the influence of the regime on film properties.Reference:Dhumal, S. S., and Suresh, A.

    "abstract": "AbstractPolyolefins including polyethylene and polypropylene are produced at a scale of over 150 million tons per year globally, which are mostly single-use plastics and end up in landfills, incinerators, or oceans. Their degradation and embrittlement produce microplastics, which may concentrate toxic organic compounds and release toxic additives including Cr (up to hundreds of ppm). Such additives may also pose challenges during polyolefin upcycling. For example, the trace metals in the plastics can gradually accumulate within the plastic upcycling catalysts impacting their performance and recyclability. They may also be undesired contaminants in the product streams. These adverse events can negatively impact both the economics and environmental sustainability aspects of the overall process. Yet, the role of trace metals in plastics during its upcycling has received scant attention. We have investigated the catalytic cracking of post-consumer high- density polyethylene (HDPE) samples, using W-based polyoxometalates that possess several advantages. For example, the high proton mobility can enhance the accessibility of acid sites during melt phase processing. Further, polyoxometalates are highly soluble in protic solvents which can be harnessed to separate the catalysts from coke and recycle them. Additionally, metals such as Cr present in plastics could potentially be reduced to a cationic state and removed by cation exchange, while the tungstate units remain in solution as anionic polyoxometalates. Harnessing these advantages, melt phase HDPE upcycling was successfully demonstrated in a fixed bed reactor wherein the cracked products were carried away by a flowing nitrogen stream. The products are mainly paraffins and coke. These results along with coke characterization and catalyst recovery will be presented. Cr in the HDPE was confirmed to accumulate in the recovered catalyst and affects the product distribution after several cycles. Possible roles of Cr in the recovered catalyst will also be discussed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRecent advances in resonance-promoted catalysis opened up a new direction in heterogenous catalyst research: the time-resolved modulation of binding energies by application of forced, cyclical external stimuli to balance rates of chemical reactions at surfaces with rates of product desorption, resulting in rates and selectivities not previously reported over similar catalysts in the absence of external stimuli.Following these, it is now possible to revisit previously reported catalytic systems wherein selectivity to desired products has been maximized, but rates are onerously slow (~24 hours reaction time at low temperature). In select cases (namely, when the catalyst system can be supported by a conducting material), we can apply concepts drawn from catalytic resonance theory to intensify these processes or increases their throughput, therefore enhancing their economic feasibility and accelerating their progression toward commercialization. An important family of chemical reaction wherein resonance promoted catalysis could enable a step-change improvement in rates and yields is the electrochemical oxidation of renewable, biomass-derived molecules into lower-carbon and sustainable specialty products, like bio-based and bio-degradable polymers. For example, the bio-degradable polymer precursor 3-hydroxybutyrate (HBA) is conventionally produce via enzymatic routes, which are costly to operate. Alternatively, PtSb alloys supported on activated carbon have been reported to oxidize 1,3-butanediol into HBA with near quantitative selectivity; but the reaction requires lower temperatures, and therefore long reactions times (~14 hours). Here, we report the effects of applying time-dependent, oscillating voltages to an electrochemical cell where the working electrode is decorated with Pt-based alloys supported on activated carbon. We quantify the effects of voltage amplitude, frequency and wave form on the rates and selectivities of 1,3-butanediol conversion at temperatures between 25-70 degrees Celsius. This work represents one important front in the new field of dynamic or resonance-promoted catalysis: de-bottlenecking of biomass-derived small molecule oxidations into renewable and bio-degradable polymers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA key challenge in the design of new catalyst formulations is elucidating those factors which control the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalytic materials; and leveraging these insights to synthesize materials with desirable properties. In this work, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel series of materials comprising supported metal and acid catalysts decorated with polymer brushes – i.e., polymer moieties of well-defined composition and dimensions grafted directly onto supports, proximal to active sites. Through non-bonding interactions with solvated reactant molecules, the polymer brushes create tailored local solvation environments so that select reactants are preferentially adsorbed from the bulk liquid phase into the local environment around the active sites. Conversely, undesired species (e.g., poisons) are excluded from the immediate vicinity of the active sites through non-favorable weak interactions with the polymer brushes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how polymer-modified solid acid catalysts enhance the selectivity of fructose dehydration to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) by suppressing the hydration of HMF into an undesirable terminal product, levulinic acid. To this end, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to estimate the solvation free energy change associated with transferring fructose and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural from the bulk solvent into the local solvation environment of the polymer brushes, modulating their length, composition and grafting density in the MD simulations, and quantifying the preferences of the solvated reactants for the polymer brushes versus the bulk liquid phase as a function of same. Those polymer-modified catalyst systems that, based upon our solvation free energy calculations, are anticipated to maximize selectivity to HMF were synthesized, and tested in bench-scale glass batch reactors.

These high-performing polymers can be made from feedstocks, such as alkyl-substituted cyclohexanones that are produced through the selective reduction of alkyl-substituted phenols obtained from lignin-derived intermediates. However, the broad range of potential lignin-derived intermediates adds complexities in processing it. Therefore, it is critical to develop a process that can accommodate the various alkyl chain and functionality in these lignin-derived intermediates. While there has been a wide range of study on the selective hydrogenation in phenolic compound, achieving high selectivity towards the desired product while maintaining high reaction activity remains a common challenge.In this work, we demonstrated the ability to achieve high selectivity (>90%) towards various alkyl-substituted cyclohexanone using a liquid phase selective hydrogenation over a Pd/Al2O3catalyst in an up-flow solid-liquid-gas phase reactor. Conversion and selectivity of the hydrogenation of phenol, p-cresol, and p-propyl-phenol was quantified to assess the reaction performance in the flow reactor system under various space velocities and hydrogen partial pressure. In addition, kinetic measurements and a stability study over time will be presented as a function of the variation of alkyl groups, metal dispersion, and different operating parameters.

    "abstract": "AbstractHydrogenolysis is an extremely effective method for plastic upcycling. Specifically, Ru-based catalysts supported on metal oxides have shown high reactivity for polyethylene upcycling. Polyethylene hydrogenolysis is an extremely structure-sensitive reaction, where product distribution depends on the size of the adsorbing alkyl chain and the hydrogen availability at the metal oxide support interface. However, surface science studies are required to characterize the structural impact of these dependencies directly.To study the arrangement of hydrocarbons to the catalyst support, we utilize X-Ray Reflectivity (XRR) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, and to study the local chemical environment changes of the Ru active site, we utilize Extended X-Ray Adsorption Fine Edge Structure (EXAFS). By utilizing hydrocarbons of various lengths (methane, hexane, dodecane, triacontane, and low-density polyethylene), we will understand preferential adsorption arrangements for undesirable and desirable product species.We theorize that as hydrocarbon chain length increases, the polymer will adsorb to the support with increased structural order, resulting in increased adsorption potential to the Ru active site. MD simulations of n-dodecane at various temperatures indicates that the preferential adsorption of species parallel to an alumina interface changes, and the application of the distorted crystal model confirms the viability of XRR as an experimental technique, as seen in the attached image. EXAFS data is currently being processed and will yield information about the local relaxation of Ru nanoparticles during species adsorption.This work aims to understand the structure and arrangement of hydrocarbons to the active metal site and the support, thus allowing for fundamental concepts to be unified and expanded upon. We anticipate our results to inspire future surface science studies to explore how different polymers adsorb to the catalyst surface—ultimately allowing for the creation of catalysts capable of mixed-polymer hydrogenolysis and reduction of energy requirements for polymer upcycling.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo date, the prediction of electronic absorption spectra of organic molecules by quantum chemical methods is still limited, with differences of even 100 nm between the theoretical and experimental values. In this work, we present a computationally cheaper approach for the design of organic polyaromatic molecules as potential organic photoredox catalysts. We focus on the first step of predicting their absorbance in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This problem is important to promote the development and use of solar energy in chemical processes. The design of new chromophoric molecules is approached as a two-step procedure. In the first step, a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model was formulated for thein-silicodesign of organic chromophores. A quantitative structure-activity relationship model was developed for the prediction of the difference in energy from the HOMO to the LUMO orbitals of organic dyes. This molecular design approach produced 4 photocatalytic molecules; 3 of these molecules have not been previously reported. In the second step, a large chemical compound database was leveraged to develop a deep learning model aimed at forecasting the absorption of visible light by such and related compounds. We have taken advantage of the deep learning model to verify that the light absorption between this model and the results of the MINLP formulation match with reasonable accuracy. For 3 of the 4 photocatalytic molecules, both results appear similar, verifying that the proposed photocatalytic molecules can absorb light close to the target wavelength. The overarching aim of this research is to extend the use of less expensive computational methods for the prediction of the rest of the important photophysical features that make up a competitive organic photoredox catalyst.",

In general, the cause of high activity of Ni-Ru/γ-Al2O3catalyst is not clear, with some studies attributing it to the Ru segregation while others ascribing it to the dispersed Ru on the Ni surface. Here, in our current research we specifically focus on establishing a structure-activity relationship for Ni-Ru/γ-Al2O3catalysts at various Ru loading using a combination of modelling and experimental tools. To begin with, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed with Gupta potential for Ni (‘x’ mole%)-Ru (‘y’ mole%) ((‘x’=99.5, 95 and 85) (‘y’=0.5, 5 and 15)) bimetallic catalysts. The MD simulations showed a dispersed morphology of Ru throughout the Ni nanoparticle for all the investigated catalysts. Subsequently, we performed lab-scale experiments to validate the catalyst structure as deciphered from the MD simulations. Ni-Ru/γ-Al2O3catalysts (Identical Ni: Ru mole% as in MD simulations) were synthesized by employing the wetness impregnation method and their crystalline phases were investigated by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. Next, we plan to investigate the elemental composition and particle size distribution of Ni and Ru in the synthesized catalysts with the aid of Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy – Energy dispersive X-ray (STEM-EDX) analysis. Subsequently, to analyze the near surface composition of the synthesized catalysts, we plan to perform X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The deciphered and validated catalyst structure information will be used to develop a reaction mechanism with quantitative information of kinetic parameters. Finally, we plan to establish a performance level relationship between the model and reactor-level experimental data on catalyst activity and reactivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrocatalytic CO2reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a viable method to recycle CO2into valuable products. Neutral or alkaline electrolytes have commonly been used for CO2RR to prevent hydrogen evolution reaction. However, the availability of CO2is limited by the homogeneous equilibrium reactions under those conditions, which consume available CO2for CO2RR and decrease the theoretical carbon efficiency. Lower pH electrolytes can avoid this issue and enable industrially relevant carbon efficiencies, but appreciable selectivity for CO2RR over HER can only be achieved under these conditions by utilizing gas diffusion layer flow cells. A few recent studies show promising results for CO2RR in acid using flow cells, but it is unclear how standard electrocatalyst preparation methods will translate from neutral/alkaline conditions to the acid case. We therefore investigate surfactant-mediated synthesis methods on the impact of CO2RR performance in acid electrolytes.We synthesized Cu nanoparticles on carbon black in ethylene glycol using different types of surfactants – hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and triton X-100, which represents cationic, anionic, and nonionic surfactants, respectively – to determine the effect of surfactants on the size and distribution of Cu nanoparticles and on resulting CO2RR performance in acid electrolyte. The results reveal that Cu nanoparticles on surfactant-treated carbon black show different product profiles and selectivity in acid using flow cell compared to Cu nanoparticles on non-treated carbon black. In addition, surfactant functionalization plays important roles in the size and uniform distribution of Cu nanoparticles and electrochemical surface area. Overall, surfactant treatment allows Cu nanoparticles to distribute uniformly on carbon black, and it enables tuning of the selectivity of multi-carbon CO2RR products based on surfactant composition.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAs the world endures environmental crises associated with climate change and the rise of atmospheric CO2concentrations from anthropogenic CO2emission, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies are increasingly necessary. Reactive carbon capture (RCC) technologies, in which capture and conversion of CO2occur in a single reactor, are more energetically and economically attractive by avoiding the need to purify, compress, and transport the captured CO2. To this end, the development of dual function materials (DFM) that enable CO2capture and conversion to useful C1 products, namely (1) methane, (2) CO, and (3) methanol, are attractive near-term targets for commercial CCU processes for renewable fuels and chemicals.DFM are composed of sorbents and catalysts co-dispersed on the same high surface area carrier. The sorbent component allows for selective capture of CO2from a gas stream and the catalyst component subsequently performs the in-situ conversion of the adsorbed CO2upon introduction of a reactive gas (typically H2). The survey of DFM formulations reveals a variety of sorbent+catalyst combinations of interest. There is, however, a lack of depth in fundamental understanding of how the CO2binds to these materials and how the subsequent reaction mechanisms are affected, which are critical features for the development of next-generation materials with improved performance. To this end, we will describe in this work the CO2binding characteristics and subsequent reaction mechanisms on a variety of DFMs and their sorbent/catalyst-only counterparts. The surface CO2binding mechanism, capture capacity, and interaction with hydrogenating catalysts for subsequent reaction will be probed using techniques such as in-situ DRIFTS, operando TGA, and CO2chemisorption.",

Cu is a vital element in photocatalytic CO2reduction using a heterogeneous catalyst, as it enhances the activity of TiO2-based photocatalysts for CO2reduction. The difference in reduced Ti state can generate Cu+/Cu2+through the interaction between the TiO2surface and Cu particles. This study aims to investigate the formation of carbon products through this difference and the role of Cu particles. To determine the mechanism change according to the charge of Cu at the beginning, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to compare the energies of C1and C2product formation through CO2reduction. Side reaction preferences were compared based on mechanism preference and energy comparison of each mechanism. The RDS was identified by the activation energy results. Bader charge analysis was performed to explain the initial Cu+and Cu2+modeling. By identifying the role of Cu particles on TiO2, a highly efficient photocatalyst can be used depending on the Cu charge, and a more efficient reaction pathway can be presented by controlling side reactions in the C1and C2product mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "AbstractZeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) are effective materials for CO2capture and show noteworthy catalytic activity owing to the presence of Lewis acidic metal centres and different functional groups on the linkers. They are green catalysts for cycloaddition of CO2with epoxides to form cyclic carbonates which is an atom efficient route for utilization of CO2. Herein, we report periodic density functional theory (DFT) based analysis of ZIF-8, ZIF-67 and ZIF-90 and their ionic liquid immobilized counterparts for CO2cycloaddition with propylene oxide to show the effect of different metal centres (Zn and Co), linker functionalities (polar and non-polar), ionic liquids, and defect centres for the cycloaddition reaction. On the surface, the dangling linker defect formed due to interaction with water forms Metal-OH most favourably in ZIF-67 while in the ZIF pores, the missing linker defect is predominant and is most favourably formed in ZIF-90. In the Lewis acid mechanism, the ring-opening of epoxide is facilitated by the Lewis acid-base pair (M-OH) while in the Brønsted acid mechanism, it is facilitated by the N-H of the linker. On the ZIF surface, the higher Lewis acidity of the Co2+than Zn2+makes the reaction more favourable on ZIF-67 than ZIF-8 while the Brønsted acid mechanism shows similar energy trend due to the same linker. The reactions are more favourable on ZIF-90 due to the presence of the polar linker (CHO functionality) which additionally enhances the Lewis acidity of the Zn2+centre. Inside the ZIF pores, the ring-closing step is unfavourable in all the ZIFs while it is favoured on surface due to the lower steric hindrance on surface. This DFT study suggests the cyclic carbonate selectivity on the ZIFs to be in the order ZIF-90 > ZIF-67 > ZIF-8, which is in line with experimental results with other epoxides.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe electrochemical CO2reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a path towards sustainable production of carbon-based fuels and chemicals, using renewable electricity to drive the conversion of CO2into products such as ethylene, ethanol, and methane. Cu is a particularly interesting catalyst, as it can form C2+products. A challenge limiting the implementation of CO2RR is catalyst stability during reduction, and greater fundamental understanding is needed to uncover the governing physical and chemical factors, as well as degradation mechanisms, in CO2RR operating conditions. The changing morphology of Cu during CO2RR operating conditions can vary the product distribution.The goal of this research was to quantify the dynamic corrosion of Cu CO2RR electrocatalysts. We hypothesized that in CO2RR conditions, the amount of degradation would be dependent on the applied potential and current. Cu electrocatalyst degradation in CO2RR conditions was examined in varying gas environments to isolate the effects of hydrogen evolution and CO2RR and potentiostatic and galvanostatic conditions in Faradaic and non-Faradaic regions to determine the effect of catalysis. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to characterize the electrode surface pre- and post- electrolysis by distinguishing nanostructures on the electrode surface and calculating surface roughness, which was found to be dependent on applied potential. While AFM allowed for examination of the resulting morphology of electrode surfaces due to various experimental conditions, the use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) enabled on-line studies for quantifying catalyst degradation. Using a flow cell allowed for simultaneously applying a potential while sending electrolyte effluent to the ICP-MS to detect corroded catalyst species in trace amounts (low ppb level). The use of on-line ICP-MS studies accelerates corrosion studies by enabling real-time measurements during reaction conditions. Elucidating the factors that drive catalyst degradation enables the assessment of the lifetime and long-term stability of electrocatalytic devices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon dioxide (CO2) is a major contributor to global warming. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) is a promising strategy to deal with increasing levels of CO2, which not only mitigates CO2emission but also allows the utilization of CO2as a feedstock for the synthesis of valuable chemicals and fuels. Direct CO2hydrogenation is one of the promising route for light olefin synthesis by increasing the single pass yield. Fe-based catalysts are considered good candidates for olefin production via CO2hydrogenation because they have dual active sites of iron oxide and iron carbide for RWGS and FTS reactions. However, Fe alone cannot achieve the high olefin yields due to its low CO2conversion and high CH4selectivity under mild operating conditions. Fe-based catalysts are often promoted with various metal oxides and alkali metals to enhance olefin selectivity and CO2adsorption capacity. In this study, we investigated the effect of metal oxides and alkali promoters on the light olefin (C2=-C4=) yield under mild operating conditions (300~350℃ and 20~30 bar).AcknowledgementThis work was supported by the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea (No. 20224C10300010).",

Specifically, the production of energy carriers, such as methane, can be achieved through the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. However, because of the limited available energy in the ISS, catalysts developed for CO2conversion must operate at low reaction temperatures (<573 K). Ni-supported particles on metal oxides (i.e., CeO2) have been shown to result in the formation of metal-oxide interfaces with active sites that facilitate CO2adsorption and activation towards the formation of methane at low reaction temperatures (<573K). Furthermore, tailoring metal oxides with rare-earth metals has been shown to alter the density of oxygen vacancies resulting from charge imbalances in host metal oxides, which lead to enhanced CO2activation sites. Here we report on the activity of Ni/CeO2with enhanced metal/oxide interface sites, which exhibits methane selectivity of 99% at CO2conversions >80%.

    "abstract": "AbstractDecreasing CO2emissions represents one of the major challenges that the modern society faces nowadays. From the different strategies that have been proposed for mitigating such emissions, the electrochemical reduction of CO2(CO2ER) has become an attractive method, since it enables the conversion of this greenhouse gas into valuable products (i.e., fuels and chemicals). However, despite the promising possibilities of this technology, CO2ER is still limited by the mass transport of CO2from the bulk to the surface of the electrode, which in turn affects the system performance. A potential strategy for enhancing the species transport in the solution relies on the application of magnetic fields in the electrochemical system.1-3In this regard, the design of efficient magneto-electrochemical systems (MECSs) calls for understanding the role of the magnetic field in the improvement of the cell’s performance. Motivated by this lack of knowledge, we herein aim at addressing the theoretical characterization of a MECS for CO2ER to syngas (CO and H2) and its subsequent experimental testing. Particularly, our system consists of a membrane-based electrochemical cell with Cu/Ag electrodes and neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnets as magnetic field sources. The theoretical model is solved in COMSOL Multiphysics and accounts for (i) the reduction and oxidation of the electroactive species and (ii) the electrolyte convection due to the interaction of the electric and magnetic fields. The prospective results of this study may be understood as the cornerstone for the design and optimization of MECSs for CO2ER not only to syngas but to other value-added products of interest.",

A novel two-dimensional nitride, MoSi2N4, was fabricated in 2020. Analogous to previous studies of MoS2, we hypothesize that edges of MoSi2N4could display interesting catalytic properties. However, there has not yet been a systematic characterization of the thermodynamic stability of various edges of MoSi2N4and their chemical behavior.In this work, we first identified a range of chemical potentials that quantify the thermodynamic favorability of formation of MoSi2N4. We then modeled several armchair and zigzag edges and calculated their edge energies to quantify their thermodynamic stability. Once the favorable edges were determined, we characterized them via electronic structure calculations (band structures and electronic density of states). The metallic Mo sites on the lowest energy edge were selected for further studies of catalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction. Viennaab initioSimulation Package was used to perform Density Functional Theory calculations.Results and Discussions:To understand the activity of edges towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, we studied the adsorption of a proton on various active edge sites of the lowest energy edge (armchair edge). Figure 1b depicts the Gibbs free-energy for sequential adsorption of H at the Mo sites. Initially, the Mo site adsorbs H very strongly with an adsorption energy of ~0.8 eV per H atom (edge+2H* in Figure 1b) and these H atoms are not expected to participate in HER. However, the Mo site is still sufficiently undercoordinated such that a third H atom can be adsorbed, and this step is thermoneutral (~0 eV). Thus, we predict that the studied armchair edge will initially adsorb H strongly (spectator species) but, beyond a critical coverage, will catalyze HER effectively.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrocatalytic reactions of organic molecules can be influenced by electrolyte composition through competitive adsorption and structural changes in the interfacial water layer. Competitive adsorption lowers surface coverage of reactants and intermediates, and thus decreases electrocatalytic rates. However, the effect of electrolyte on interfacial water layer and how it affects adsorption of organics is less understood. Herein, we report the effects of cations and anions in electrolytes on the adsorption strength of phenol on polycrystalline platinum (Pt). We focus on ions that do not specifically adsorb to Pt to elucidate how non-specific adsorption of ions and structural changes to the interfacial water layer affect phenol adsorption. We use atomistic modeling to predict the adsorption free energy of anions (ClO4-, NO3-, and CH3COO‑) and cations (Li+, Na+, and Cs+) on Pt(111) as a function of applied electrochemical potential. We determine a potential range in which ions do not adsorb in the hydrogen underpotential deposition (Hupd) region of Pt where we experimentally study phenol adsorption strength. We predict that none of the considered cations adsorb on Pt(111) in the Hupdregion. Further, we predict that ClO4-and NO3-do not readily adsorb on Pt(111), consistent with previous work in the field,1while CH3COO‑adsorbs on Pt(111). We model the adsorption energy of phenol in the presence of ions using molecular dynamics simulations and validate our model against cyclic voltammetry experiments. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of electrolytes on the aqueous-phase adsorption of phenol on Pt will improve our understanding of phenol hydrogenation and oxidation, which is relevant to bio-oil production and organic pollution abatement.References:(1) Kamat, G.

Herein, we report a synergistic theoretical and experimental study showing that TiO2electrodes embedded with subsurface redox-active Mn atoms enable water oxidation to H2O2at low overpotentials. Mn-alloyed TiO2is fabricated using a Ultratech Fiji G2 ALD system with tetrakisdimethylamido-titanium. bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl)manganese, and water as the coreactant at 150 °C with pne MnOxALD cycle applied for every eight TiO2cycles.Density functional theory calculations show that first-row transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co) serve as reservoirs of oxidizing equivalents that couple to substrate binding sites on the surface of redox-inert metal oxides. The distinct sites for substrate binding and redox state transitions reduce the overpotential of the critical first step of water oxidation, the oxidization of surface adsorbed H2O* to HO* enhancing the selectivity for H2O2.The electrochemical behavior of TiMnOxelectrodes was measured using a Bio-Logic S200 potentiostat system, a saturated calomel reference electrode, and a Ti foil counter electrode in a .5M phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.4. Product quantification was carried out in an H-cell configuration with a Nafion 117 membrane separating the TiMnOxworking electrode from the Ti foil counter electrode. H2O2concentration was quantified by KMnO4spectrophotometric titration.Electrochemical analysis of ALD grown Mn-alloyed TiO2electrodes confirm the theoretical predictions, showing enhanced selectivity for H2O2generation (>90%) due to a significant shift of the onset potential (1.8 V vs RHE), a 500mV cathodic shift when compared to pristine TiO2(2.3 V vs RHE). These findings show that alloying metal oxides with subsurface redox-active sites represent a promising strategy for the design of catalytic materials due to the uncoupling of substrate binding and catalytic redox-state transitions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTwo dimensional materials such as graphene and MXenes have garnered significant popularity for a variety of electrocatalytic reactions owed to their unique structural and electronic properties. Dimensional confinement provides a large surface area-to-volume ratio allowing for more actives sites while also providing unique electronic properties due to quantum confinement, whereby the electronic band structure deviates from its 3D counterpart. The introduction of transition metal (TM) dopants and non-metal ligands (B, C, N, O, Si, P, S) can further modulate the electronic properties (ergo catalytic properties) of 2D materials. A large-scale computational assessment of surface intermediates on these pristine and doped 2D structures will give invaluable insight into the catalytic nature of this relatively new class of materials. However, a full assessment of the catalytic properties of just one combination of dopant and 2D material requires numerous DFT calculations performed in serial to obtain: lattice parameters, stability of doped sites, and surface intermediates. Keeping track of and curating these calculations for one, let alone thousands, of combinations can become overwhelmingly unwieldy. We addressed this issue by constructing a high-throughput workflow that automates this entire process. In addition to performing DFT relaxations to assess the thermodynamic quantities, the workflow will also assessed the electronic properties after each calculation by obtaining the density of states and integrated crystal orbital Hamiltonian population. The initial dataset covers oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on TM and ligand doped graphene and MXenes (TM4X3, TM3X2, TM2X, with X= C or N and TM=3d, 4d, and 5d TMs). We specifically calculated the interaction of the three surface intermediates (O*, OH*, OOH*) of OER interacting with the TM dopant on the 2D plane. The dataset provided is carefully curated and archived in a public database that can be accessible through our API which will assist in data analytics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a biomass-derived feedstock and its derivatives can be used to produce plastics, chemicals, and liquid fuels. 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) are oxidized derivatives of HMF, which can be served as precursors to synthesize bio-based polymers (i.e., polyethylene furanoate) and pharmaceuticals (i.e., macrocyclic ligands). Several thermochemical ways have been developed to selectively oxidize HMF, but those processes require harsh reaction conditions such as high oxygen pressure (> 2.5 bar) and elevated temperatures (> 100 °C) and often use toxic chemicals such as oxidizing agents. Compared to conventional thermochemical processes, electrochemical HMF oxidations have gathered attention as sustainable routes due to their mild operating conditions without toxic chemicals. Extensive research has been done on electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF in aqueous solutions. It has been known that the selectivity, yield, and faradaic efficiency of HMF oxidation largely depend on the pH of solutions and the composition of electrocatalysts. However, there is a lack of studying local pH near the electrocatalyst surfaces during the HMF oxidation reactions, which can affect kinetics and efficiency of the reactions. Herein, we aim toin-situmonitor the local pH during the heterogeneous electrocatalytic HMF oxidation processes and correlate their impact on electrocatalytic activities. Gold and copper were chosen as model electrocatalysts, served as substrate electrodes of scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM). Surface-functionalized tip electrode with pH-sensitive redox mediator (4-nitrothiophenol) displayed Nernstian shift in cyclic voltammogram, enabling detection of local pH in small gap between tip and substrate electrodes of SECM cells. In addition, selective detection of products of HMF oxidation at the tip electrode could distinguish electrocatalytic activities at the gold and copper electrocatalyst surfaces. The relationship between local pH and electrocatalytic activities established in this study would provide useful information for the design of electrochemical HMF oxidation processes with high selectivity and yield.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFinding a sustainable bifunctional cheaper catalyst suitable for both the oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) reactions has been a major shortcoming in both metal-air battery and fuel-cell technologies. These catalysts need to offer selectivity and stability on top of excellent activity to be able to compete with the current commercial catalyst. This work analyzes the activity and tuning of an inexpensive catalyst; a two-dimensional metal organic framework (2D-MOF) that has been recently synthesized experimentally. Utilizingab initiospin-polarized DFT calculations, the dominating pathways and rate-limiting steps of the ORR/OER reactions have been simulated.The 2D-MOF was tuned through the addition of a graphene substrate and substrate doping. The 2D-MOF can be synthesized using various transition metals for the two-metal center active sites, however, only cobalt, iron, and a combination of the two metals were simulated in this work due to their history with promising ORR/OER activity. The Co-2D-MOFs were favorable towards OER while the Fe-2D-MOFs were favorable towards ORR. The results show that when the bimetallic Co/Fe-2D-MOF was supported by boron-doped graphene, the ORR overpotential of the Fe-site was found to be 0.56 eV and the OER overpotential of the Co-site was found to be 0.48 eV. The present study allows for us to understand the activity of the 2D-MOF and the effect that a substrate has towards ORR/OER activity.AcknowledgmentsAcknowledgment is made to the State Legislative Fund, New Mexico for financial support.

    "abstract": "AbstractDue to the increasing energy demand and environmental concerns, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes are considered as sustainable ways to produce clean energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. For example, (photo-)electrochemical water splitting process is one of the promising methods to yield clean hydrogen fuels. However, industrial implementation of the processes is hindered by the sluggish heterogeneous reaction kinetics and the use of costly materials. Carbon-based materials have attracted attention due to advantages including low cost, tunability in chemical structures, and stability in acidic and alkaline solutions. Among the carbon-based materials, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for electrocatalysts and/or photocatalysts because of the abundant active sites and large optical absorption coefficients. Significant advances have been made in designing CQDs for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical applications. However, further development is hindered by a lack of quantitative understanding of the electrocatalytic activity of CQDs at molecular-level. Here, we seek to quantify surface intermediates on CQDs with varied compositions during the electrocatalytic reactions by using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). CQDs with different concentrations of heteroatoms (N, S, and P) were synthesized and deposited on the substrate electrode of SECM cell. Surface interrogation mode of SECM were used to quantitatively analyze surface intermediates at the CQD surfaces during the heterogeneous electrocatalytic water splitting reactions, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, we will discuss our recent efforts toward CQDs for potential photoelectrochemical water splitting applications. This work would give insight on designing cost-effective and efficient carbon-based materials for sustainable energy conversions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe issues of global carbon emissions and environmental pollution are becoming increasingly severe. From the perspective of green chemistry, the use of visible light as an energy source and molecular oxygen (O2) or ambient air as an oxidant to establish efficient and selective oxidative synthesis routes has attracted great attention. The development of efficient catalytic conversion using inexpensive and structurally simple novel visible light catalysts is an important challenge in the field of visible light catalysis. In this context, cost-effective sulfur-containing photosensitizers have recently gained increasing interest.This study aims to carry out controllable photocatalytic molecular oxygen oxidation based on sulfur-containing photosensitizers. In the preliminary stage, selective construction of C-O, C-C, and C-N was achieved by disulfide-mediated reactions. Under continuous flow photochemical conditions, the efficiency of gas-liquid phase photocatalytic reactions was significantly improved. Currently, research is being conducted on the photocatalytic molecular oxygen oxidation of water-soluble sulfur quantum dots. Through controllable etching of sulfur quantum dots and ligand modification with specific functional structures, molecular oxygen can be progressively activated for oxidation. This enables selective C(sp3)-H oxidation reactions of important organic small molecules such as amines, alcohols, aromatics, and alkanes, as well as oxidative cleavage reactions of alkene carbon-carbon double bonds. Non-metallic pure element sulfur quantum dots are used as photocatalysts in this study to achieve efficient and highly selective molecular oxygen oxidation in aqueous solution, opening up a new approach for essential green, safe, and efficient oxidation reactions.",

The design of high-performance and durable electrodes for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the AEMWE system is crucial for efficient hydrogen production. In this work, a highly effective NiFe-LDH self-supported OER electrode was prepared on nickel felt substrate through the hydrothermal method and then applied as the anode of the AEMWE. Benefit from in-situ growth on the nickel fibers and addition of conductive carbon black, the obtained NiFe-LDH self-supported electrode only required an overpotential of 275 mV to deliver 100 mA cm-2for OER. In the lab-scale AEMWE system, the NiFe-LDH self-supported electrode served as the anode exhibited enhanced performance (1.5A cm-2@1.94 V) and superior durability with a low degradation rate at 500 mA cm-2for 100 h at 60 ℃.

The process of converting these light alkanes into high-value commodity chemicals is promising but typically requires high temperatures or even high pressures. The direct conversion of light alkanes into valuable chemicals under ambient conditions presents a fundamentally challenging approach.Herein we report an electrochemically assisted reaction system to convert light alkanes into olefins and oxygenates with high efficiency at ambient conditions. Our system can convert ethane to ethylene and acetic acid with a production rate of 6.92 and 6.23 µmol h−1cm−2, respectively, and a combined selectivity of above 90%, and can convert propane to propene with a production rate of 11.6 µmol h−1cm−2and a selectivity of over 81% at a positively biased electrode potential, while methane is mainly converted to carbon dioxide.

    "abstract": "AbstractAbout 93% of adipic acid, a nylon precursor, is produced from KA oil, a mixture of cyclohexanone (K) and cyclohexanol (A). KA oil is produced from cyclohexane oxidation at 0.8-2 MPa and 140-180◦C in the presence of transition metal catalysts and atmospheric oxygen. Because KA oil is more easily oxidized than cyclohexane, cyclohexane oxidation conversion is typically limited to below 9% to ensure high selectivity. An electrochemical approach to cyclohexane oxidation is potentially a safer, more efficient approach to synthesis of KA oil.A limited number of studies have recently demonstrated the viability and improved performance of electrochemical cyclohexane oxidation to KA oil using annular, two-electrode flow reactors to achieve >99% selectivity for KA oil production. Although these results are promising, fundamental questions about the reaction mechanism and even the identity of the reactants remain. Lack of reference electrode in previous two-electrode studies prevents relation of operating potentials at the anode and cathode to thermodynamic references to quantify kinetic overpotentials, transport limitations, and ohmic losses. Furthermore, complex, undivided flow reactors introduce more variables that make analysis and reproducing results across groups more difficult.In this work, we elucidate the mechanism of electrochemical cyclohexane oxidation on different electrode materials using a batch, divided cell with a reference electrode. Using chronoamperometry, isotopic labeling, and chemical analysis, we determine voltage dependence and the role of water and O2in cyclohexane conversion to KA oil. Electrode characterization before and after operation reveals structural changes, such as corrosion, from high voltage. Additionally, we demonstrate that crossover from the counter electrode needs to be considered when studying KA oil production. Our findings provide foundational insights for creating guidelines on electrochemical oxidation of alkanes and other petrochemicals. Advancing fundamental understanding in this field can help inform the broader field of C-H bond activation and organic electrosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe surface-electrolyte microenvironment plays an important role in the performance of renewable electrochemical energy technologies such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, and batteries. Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuels cells and electrolyzers have the advantage of operation at higher current densities and having higher stability toward load cycling and shutdowns compared to alkaline fuel cells and electrolyzers. Focusing on the oxygen-based (oxygen reduction reaction-ORR and oxygen evolution reaction-OER) electrochemical reactions, which typically hamper the efficiency of fuel cells and electrolyzers,1,2respectively, due to the sluggish kinetics, a fundamental understanding of acid electrolyte anion effects at or near the electrocatalytic surface may engineer better electrode- electrolyte interfaces with tuned local surface-electrolyte microenvironments and help facilitate the design of non-noble electrocatalytic materials.Previous theoretical and experimental work has been focused on studying anion effects in acidic media using Pt electrocatalysts and changes in performance as a function of anion species have been generally attributed to competitive adsorption. Anion effects on other catalytic materials have not been investigated in detail. Therefore, to better understand acid electrolyte anion effects on the ORR and OER activity of both strong and weak oxygen-binding metals and metal oxides, we consider Pt3, Pd4, Ag, and IrO2. We evaluated various electrolytes (HClO4, HNO3, H2SO4, H3PO4, HF, HCl, HBr, and HI) interaction in the electrochemical double-layer microenvironment and how these anions modify the adsorption energies of the ORR and OER reaction intermediates. These insights provide guidance on opportunities to improve performance for ORR and OER catalysts and related electrochemical energy technologies.1Shih, A.

In order to better understand the role of TiO2in these composites, the local pH change was characterized during HER. The composites were electrodeposited onto copper mesh working electrodes in close vicinity to a flat-bottom pH probe; conditions for the deposit were determined from steady state voltammetry experiments and the deposit composition characterized. HER was compared with different electrocatalyst composition in an alkaline NaOH electrolyte reporting overpotential, Tafel slope and the exchange current density. There was a significant enhancement in the HER overpotential and exchange current density when TiO2particles were present in the alloy. The enhancement was associated with a local pH change. Without TiO2particles present in the solid state, the local pH change follows an expected increase with time as hydrogen is evolved and the hydroxide ion is generated at the electrode surface. In contrast, when TiO2particles were present at the surface and in the metal alloy matrix, the local pH initially decreases slightly and remains constant. The results suggest that the enhanced HER performance with TiO2in the alloy composite electrocatalyst is a consequence of the buffering of the local pH.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPhotocatalytic water splitting is a promising sustainable method for hydrogen production, but has been limited by low efficiencies and complex scale-up procedures. The latter is partially attributed to the lack of detailed kinetic data with most studies difficult to be reproduced or validated because of the special experimental configurations and aggregated data presented. Herein, we present a detailed dataset for the photocatalytic water splitting, using an in-house covalent organic framework catalyst and ascorbic acid as the sacrificial agent. The experimental investigation included multiple factors affecting the kinetic characteristics i.e., temperature, photocatalyst loading, sacrificial agent loading, illumination duration and intensity. Moreover, phenomena such as the co-catalyst (Platinum nanoparticles) photodeposition, reactants and products sorption and desorption, and catalyst deactivation were examined in detail. One of the main advantages of the study is the high resolution of temporal hydrogen evolution measurements, employing our lab-scale photoreactor cell coupled with a Residual Gas Analyzer for the collection of mass spectrographs for the evolved gases. In addition, spent photocatalyst was characterized morphologically using high resolution scanning field emission scanning electron microscopy. In parallel, the oxidation kinetics of ascorbic acid were captured with and without the photocatalyst using light spectrometry. The collected data were combined into a three steps apparent kinetic model able to describe the experimental data with an accuracy better than R20.75 in most cases. Other literature photochemical kinetic models were tested and fitted on the experimental data in order to assess their applicability in hydrogen production via water splitting.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBench-scale treatment facilities that are easy to operate and maintain in remote locations can find wide implementation in curbing the impact of potable water availability. Organic compounds have been found to be some of the most omnipresent and persistent contaminants found in wastewaters. Efficient and cost-effective photodegradation of these contaminants relies on catalysts with high activity in the visible-light region, favorable kinetics, and resilient performance stability. A clear lack of attention has been given towards investigating the photoactivity of other transition metal oxides (TMO) upon chemical reduction after the serendipitous discovery of ‘black’ TiO2. To this end, some metal oxide photocatalysts such as V2O5exhibit poor intrinsic photoactivity due to a deep conduction band (CB) edge limiting major reduction reactions (i.e., reduction of oxygen to superoxide radicals) from forming which can be paramount to photodegradation abilities. Herein, we report a novel, vacancy rich, black V2O5material (bV2O5) synthesized using a controllable and environmentally benign physicochemical reduction method. First principle density function theory (DFT+U) analyses reveal that tuning a high degree of surface oxygen vacancies considerably ameliorated visible light photoactivity of practically inactive pristine V2O5(pV2O5). The heterojunction between surface pV2O5and bV2O5crystals on the same homogenously dispersed microstructure allows for the creation of effective trap states. The modest degree of intercalated Na+in bV2O5- introduced through NaBH4reduction – is believed to facilitate neighboring photogenerated electrons to transfer along the bridge-Na sites. Both these aid in inhibiting the electron-hole recombination rate, which enhances visible light photodegradation kinetics. The optimized bV2O5photocatalyst was confirmed to actively achieve 92% methylene blue (MB; 20 mg/L) photodegradation in 1 h under 0.7 kW/m2visible-light intensity, after reaching adsorption equilibrium (capacity = 75 mg/L methylene blue (MB)) without light illumination irradiation – corresponding to a 58-fold increase in photodegradation efficiency over pristine V2O5.",

However, the high cost and sluggish reaction kinetics of conventional platinum catalysts for fuel cells have hindered large-scale commercialization of fuel cells. Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) has been an auspicious electrocatalyst to replace platinum in PEMFCs for quite some time due to their superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, better stability, and non-precious nature. Immobilizing FePc over graphene substrate leads to enhanced electron conductivity, prevention of FePc aggregation, greater stability, and increased number of active sites, while B doping of the graphene substrate regulates the electronic structure to yield enhanced ORR activity. As a result, the overall catalytic performance of the catalyst surpasses that of the conventional Pt/C cathode of the fuel cell. Focusing on this synergistic effect due to the pi-pi stacking interaction between B doped graphene and FePc, we will discuss about the synthesis method of the catalyst and various characterization methods employed to elucidate the underlying physical and electronic structure leading to the ORR activity.

    "abstract": "AbstractGlobal efforts to decarbonize the chemical industry are directed towards electrification of manufacturing processes. Hydrogen plays a crucial role in industrial manufacturing; making it imperative to understand mechanisms and dynamics of hydrogen transfer through catalytic materials. We are specifically studying hydrogen transfer in redox-active metal oxides as candidates for next-generation catalytic architectures. We are further focusing on probing the inter-relationships between hydrogen transfer electrocatalysis across molecular and extended oxide materials, which we refer to as the “molecules-to-materials design continuum.”The focus of this presentation will be a comparison of the catalyst activity and selectivity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on tungsten polyoxometalates and tungsten oxide nanoclusters. We have hypothesized that thermal treatment of tungsten polyoxometalates over a range of temperatures will result in the loss of stabilizing ligands and/or counterions with progressive rearrangement into disordered clusters and ultimately crystalline nanoparticles, where each of the accessible forms of the oxide will exhibit different behavior under ORR conditions. The experimental design that we are implementing is as follows:The tungsten polyoxometalates are supported on conductive carbon using electrostatic adsorption, followed by controlled thermal treatments up to 400oC to progressively evolve the chemical composition from well-defined molecules to well-defined crystalline nanomaterials.The supported catalysts are coated as films on glassy carbon electrodes for ORR measurements under standard conditions using rotating disk and ring-disk electrode voltammetry.Analysis of the ORR linear sweep voltammetry provides information on the ORR rate constants for each catalyst structure as well as its selectivity to 2 versus 4-electron oxygen reduction.This approach is designed to facilitate direct comparisons between catalytic behavior for molecular clusters and extended solids of mutual similar composition under the overarching hypothesis that these comparisons will reveal important information about the impact of active site composition and electronic structure on H-transfer catalysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFormic acid has garnered attention due to its capacity to store hydrogen in larger quantities, resulting in a higher energy density and a safer transportation alternative. Previous research on platinum-catalyzed electro-oxidation of formic acid has shown that applied potential oscillations can yield rates up to ~20 times higher than the maximum static conditions. In this work, we examined the effects of potential oscillations on faradaic and thermodynamic efficiency and the impact of the duty cycle (time spent at each potential) on the rate of CO2formation. The potential oscillations were applied from 0 V to 0.8 vs NHE in a square-wave form. Kinetic and electrochemical measurements revealed that oscillations do not significantly impact faradaic efficiency but increase thermodynamic efficiency relative to static conditions. The duty cycle significantly influences the CO2formation rate, with the maximum rate achieved at a 95% (0.8 V vs NHE) duty cycle. However, a thermodynamic efficiency penalty is associated with the duty cycle, which defines the limitations of dynamic potential modulation that balance energy efficiency and rate. Optimum conditions can be established based on the importance assigned to the kinetic and thermodynamic parity conditions and the available resources considered. When the thermodynamic efficiency is set equal to the static maximum when energy conservation is vital, the CO2formation rate is enhanced approximately 10 times higher. On the other hand, when the rate is set equal to the static maximum when maximizing production is important, the thermodynamic efficiency increases approximately three times higher.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe ring-opening of epoxides with alcohols produces high-value intermediates. Lewis and Brønsted acidic materials, including zeolites, catalyze this chemistry. However, few explanations of what factors govern differences in mechanisms, turnover rates, and regioselectivities between these materials exist. The effects of metal identity and solvation effects within zeolite pores must be considered for the design of better ring-opening catalysts. Here, we examine the consequences of varying the active metal (Al, Sn, Ti, Zr) on rates and regioselectivities for 1,2-epoxybutane (C4H8O) ring-opening with methanol (CH3OH) in acetonitrile solvent (CH3CN) over zeolite *BEA.Among Lewis acids, ring-opening rates proceed in the order Ti < Zr < Sn, correlating with reported metal Lewis acid strengths. Rates depend on [CH3OH] (where [x] denotes concentration) and [C4H8O]. A single kinetic regime appears to dominate at all conditions over Al-BEA-20, whereas each Lewis acid shows two kinetic regimes. These results suggest that Lewis and Brønsted acidic materials catalyze ring-opening with distinct prevailing surface species or through different mechanisms.Regioselectivities towards the terminal ether product exceed 50% under most conditions but depend on both metal identity and reagent concentrations. Selectivity towards the terminal ether generally decreases with increasing [CH3OH] and increases with greater [C4H8O] over each M-BEA-20. Al-BEA-20 consistently gives the lowest regioselectivities to the terminal ether, with Ti- and Zr-BEA-20 showing the greatest regioselectivities. Activation enthalpy and reactant and product adsorption enthalpies, obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry, suggest regioselectivities stem from differences in the free energies of the transition states to form each product. Methanol uptake measurements further suggest that differences in solvation between transition states contribute to regioselectivity changes.This work demonstrates that regioselectivities for epoxide ring-opening are controlled by both inner sphere (i.e., choice of active metal, acid type) and outer sphere (i.e., intrapore solvent environment) interactions in zeolite pores.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe growing demand for poly(propene) derived from light olefins has led to the development of olefin metathesis catalysts that exhibit high activity and selectivity toward propene. Atomically dispersed tungsten oxide on amorphous silica (WOx/SiO2) is a promising catalyst to produce propene from ethene and 2-butene. However, the formation mechanism of the active sites of WOx/SiO2is debated due to the low abundance of active sites and the amorphous nature of silica. Herein, we investigate the role of grafting site heterogeneity in active site formation on WOx/SiO2. The study examines how the dihedral angle of grafted WOx/SiO2and local ring strain of silica affect the formation of the W-carbene active site for ethene and 2-butene metathesis to propene. Cluster models of WOx/SiO2are used to study the effect of the vicinal silanol dihedral angle interaction on the formation of the W-carbene species. We vary the size of the supporting siloxane ring structure and model the reaction pathway for W-carbene active site formation using ethene or 2-butene. Density functional theory (DFT) and microkinetic modeling are used to quantify the effect of the WOxgrafting site heterogeneity on SiO2for the active site formation. We also predict that 2-butene promotes formation of W-carbene via the pseudo-Wittig reaction faster than ethene. The transferability of qualitative trends predicted using WOx/SiO2cluster models to periodic slab models of amorphous silica is also investigated. In summary, this study provides molecular-level insight into propene metathesis on the industrially relevant WOx/SiO2catalyst.References:(1) Howell, J. G.; Li, Y.-P.; Bell, A. T.

    "abstract": "AbstractCopper-exchanged zeolites catalytically convert methane to methanol (533-573 K) with high selectivity (50-100%) at low conversions (<0.1%). Prior studies determined that increasing the framework Al content and decreasing the extraframework Cu content increases the selectivity towards methanol, but have not identified how these bulk compositional variables affect the number and structure of active Cu sites formed during steady-state partial methane oxidation (PMO) catalysis. Herein, we studied how the distribution of Cu active sites in CHA was affected by increasing the extraframework Cu site density and by altering the density and arrangement of framework Al atoms in chabazite (CHA) zeolites, and their influences on continuous PMO rates, selectivity, and apparent reaction orders. The number of 6-MR paired Al sites in CHA was varied by adapting established methods to use different combinations of organic and inorganic structure-directing agents during crystallization and quantified through Co(II) titration. All Cu-CHA samples showed PMO rates that were nearly first-order in methane pressure, consistent with prior reports that suggest C-H activation in methane is the rate limiting step in continuous PMO. Cu-CHA samples with different framework Al arrangements showed that formation rates of over-oxidation products (e.g., CO2) had different apparent reaction orders in O2, implying differences in the Cu structures formed during reaction. The number of redox-active Cu sites were quantified through linear combination fitting of XANES spectra collected underin-situand transient conditions after reactant (O2) cut-off. Characterization of Cu sites usingin-situand transientXAS and UV-visible spectroscopies indicate different types of binuclear Ox-bridged Cu active sites are formed during reaction and are influenced by the arrangement of framework Al atoms in CHA. These findings highlight the effects of Al density, Al arrangement, and Cu density on the structures of extraframework Cu complexes that form during partial oxidation catalysis to influence rates and selectivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMethanol-to-olefins (MTO) conversion provides a potentially sustainable route to small olefins. MTO is also mechanistically interesting, as surface species referred to as “hydrocarbon pool” are believed to be essential for catalytic turnover. Insights into the chemistry of these species may allow addressing key challenges in MTO, such as olefin selectivity and deactivation. While the presence of cyclic species is well documented in the literature, knowing the exact constitution of these species and distinguishing relevant intermediates from spectators remain challenging tasks. Moreover, experimental values for the energy barriers associated with the transformations inside the pores are lacking. Here, measurement and data analysis protocols are established to gain access to such barriers. The ring contraction of 1,3,5,5-tetramethylcyclohexadiene (TMCH) is one of several MTO-relevant model reactions, and mordenite serves as a model catalyst with pores large enough to permit adsorption of this reactant. In situ diffuse reflectance UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy are used to monitor the transformation kinetics. Both methods show that TMCH is protonated to cyclohexenyl cations, which are stable enough in the pores to be observable (π – π* transition at 314 nm and C=C-C+stretch at 1548 cm-1). These cyclohexenyl cations contract to alkyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cations (292 nm, 1504 cm-1). Detailed analysis of UV-vis and IR spectra reveals a more complicated reaction network. Cyclopentenyl cations of different constitution are formed, that are distinguished by the substitution pattern of the allylic system (1,2,3 alkyl vs 1,3 alkyl-substituted). Band overlap and background effects present an additional challenge to extracting kinetics, making necessary careful data treatment and analysis. It is demonstrated that true activation energies for such surface transformations from reactant to product state can be determined from measurements at various temperatures, and comparison with reported data from liquid acid catalysis confirms their reasonableness.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPreviously, we have demonstrated a facile technique for depositing bare-surface and uniform-sized gold nanoparticles (3-4 nm dia.) inside the small pores of mesoporous silica (6.6 nm dia.)—porousgold catalysts. These catalysts are extremely active in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol without any thermal treatments. Their surface turnover frequency (26.4 s-1), a normalized measurement for intrinsic catalytic activity, is higher than the control catalysts (20.7 s-1), prepared by depositing the same gold nanoparticles onto the amorphous silica—nonporousgold catalysts. This indicates that the pore structure enhances catalysis. We have hypothesized that theporousgold catalysts do not induce mass-transfer (i.e., translation) limitations and restrain the random rotation of the reagent (i.e., benzyl alcohol). We have developed a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based characterization (e.g., diffusion-ordered spectroscopy and T1relaxation) with theporous/nonporousgold catalysts to probe the translational and rotational motions of the reagent near the gold surface via the measurements of translational and rotational diffusivities. They are measured at different temperatures and correlated to the Arrhenius equation to determine the activation energy that quantifies the thermal energy barriers, where a higher activation energy indicates the increased restraint of that type of motion. A nearly 200 % reduction in the activation energy of translation and a 200 % increase in the activation energy of rotation were observed for the reagent in theporousgold catalysts compared to thenonporousgold catalysts. These results indicate that, compared to the control catalysts, theporousgold catalysts can better facilitate the transportation of the reagent to/from the gold surface and effectively reduce the random rotation of the reagent, potentially optimizing the adsorption of the reagent on the gold surface, and ultimately, improving the catalysts’ activity and selectivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAdsorptive desulfurization (ADS) has shown the ability to produce sulfur free fuels under ambient conditions, avoiding the high energy requirements of the traditional hydrodesulfurization process. Using food waste derived activated carbons (FWAC) gives the added benefits of low sorbent cost and repurposing waste material. Carbon materials from other sources have previously been effective ADS sorbents.1FWAC materials have high surface area and a pore structure than can be tuned via the activation process to achieve the desired morphology ideal for ADS. To synthesize these sorbents, processed food waste was first washed to remove impurities and then dried, ground, and sieved for uniform particle size. The prepared food waste was pyrolyzed to produce biochar, which was steam activated to FWAC. By controlling the steam pressure, reactor temperature, and activation time, FWAC samples with different physical properties can be produced. Additionally, acid treatment with HNO3can modify the surface properties to improve adsorption. FWAC samples were characterized and fixed bed adsorption experiments measured their capacity for 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (DMDBT) in octane model fuel consisting of 100 ppm sulfur with 1 wt% naphthalene. Breakthrough curves show that the highly mesoporous FWAC sorbents have exceptional capacity for DMDBT, surpassing ADS performance previously demonstrated by other materials.2This can be attributed to the presence of surface oxygen groups as well as large surface area and mesopore volume allowing for diffusion and adsorption of DMDBT. This technology is a promising solution to reduce the sulfur content of hydrocarbon fuels to below required limits at significant energy and cost savings compared to hydrodesulfurization. The use of renewable materials as sorbents in this process will further minimize the overall environmental impact.Zhou, A.; et al.Catal. B Environ.2009, 87, 190–199.Lee, K. X.; et al.Eng. Chem.

    "abstract": "AbstractLarge-scale carbon capture and recycling (CCR) is projected to play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of climate change. One promising method for achieving this goal is the industrial production of chemicals and fuel from CO2and CH4. Transformation of CO2and CH4into a CO-rich stream through the dry reforming of methane (DRM) at low temperatures (<500°C) is highly desirable due to its potential for economic viability and high CO2utilization. Despite being a well-studied reaction, conventional catalysts have limitations, including coke formation, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. Therefore, sophisticated heterogeneous catalyst design and surface chemistry modulation are necessary to overcome these hurdles. Intermetallic nanoparticles (iNPs) composed of an ordered crystal structure and a well-defined atomic arrangement of transition and post-transition metals, provide the catalytic design space for surface chemistry modulation for improved catalytic properties.In this work, the electronic state and surface environment of a Ni­­-Zn intermetallic catalyst for low-temperature CO2reforming of methane were effectively controlled. Through careful bimetallic combination and composition tuning, intermetallic bulk structures with distinct surface compositions and structures were created, altering the surface's reactivity and selectivity through electronic, ensemble, and steric effects. The results showed that charge separated paired sites (Ni𝛿--Zn𝛿+) iNPs encapsulated in SiO2increased catalytic activity (syngas production) by a factor of 4 and exhibited enhanced stability during a 160-hour time on stream test at 450°C, while limiting coke formation by four orders of magnitude compared to monometallic Ni. This work provides an approach for surface chemistry control through bimetallic compositional tuning and modification via adsorbate/ligand in heterogeneous catalyst design for relevant reaction systems involving C-H, C=O, and C-C activation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe development of efficient catalysts for dry reforming of methane (DRM) is critical for the sustainable production of syngas, an essential precursor for many industrial processes. DRM is known to have a high energy penalty due to the intrinsic chemical stability of the CO2molecule. The mechanism suggests that CO2is activated at the metal-support interphase while methane is activated on the surface of the active metals. Therefore, the reaction can be significantly improved by designing new catalysts that maximize the metal-support interactions (MSI) and consequently facilitate CO2activation. In this work, we explore the use of MXene (Ti3C2Tx) as support for Ni catalysts to address their low deactivation resistance during DRM. MXenes are a new family of layered and porous two-dimensional materials with exceptional properties that can be harnessed in catalysis. Ni is low-cost, naturally abundant, and exhibits decent activity under relatively mild reaction conditions. Wet impregnation was used to synthesize MXene-supported Ni catalysts (Ni/Ti3C2Tx) and a reference catalyst (γ-Al2O3-supported Ni) with ten wt% loadings. The morphology and composition of the catalysts and the tailored surface functional groups of the MXenes obtained from electron microscopic and spectroscopic techniques have been correlated with their catalytic activity during dry reforming at atmospheric pressure.

    "abstract": "AbstractTo reduce society’s reliance on fossil fuels, the development of alternative, sustainable pathways for producing carbon-neutral liquid fuels and valuable chemicals have been of increasing importance in recent years. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technology, which involves utilising CO2 emissions as a carbon resource to produce important chemical products, represents an integral component of carbon mitigation and decarbonisation strategies.Hydroformylation is a chemical process of great industrial significance. This is mainly centred around producing n-butanal, a key precursor to pharmaceutical chemicals, plasticizers and alternative fuels (butanol). CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a key topic in recent sustainability-focused research efforts. Utilisation of CO2 as a mild oxidant has been shown to provide significant thermodynamic and stability advantages to the energy-intensive dehydrogenation process. Due to the presence of the reverse water-gas shift pathway in this reaction, it was postulated that direct conversion from the alkane to the target aldehyde is possible, using CO2 as the carbon source and to gain significant performance advantages due to equilibrium and oxidative effects. Accordingly, this study was conducted to develop a novel catalyst and reactor system for the tandem catalysis of CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydroformylation to produce butanal (Fig 1).The thermodynamic study conducted with ASPEN Plus provided significant insight into the favourable pathways and optimal operating conditions in this envisioned tandem reaction system. Employment of a multi-temperature zone furnace facilitated catalytic testing with multiple catalytic beds at a temperature gradient in a modular reactor tube. Catalytic performance was determined from the product compositions obtained during catalytic runs. Catalyst characterisation with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis and temperature-programmed desorption provided crucial insights into catalytic behaviour.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a single direct reaction that converts methane into ethylene with the help of a catalyst using some amount of oxygen. The OCM takes place at high temperatures, usually between 700 to 900 °C, and generates a significant amount of heat; the control of which is a major challenge. The reaction is governed by a selectivity-conversion compromise that strongly depends on the used catalyst and operating conditions. This work explores the use of economic objective functions in reactor design to address the disconnect between design objectives at the reactor scale and those at the process level. The reactor design optimization is performed for a multi-zone reactor considering design decisions on the distribution of methane, oxygen, and inert feeds along the reactor, feed ratios of each zone inlets, cold shot temperatures, and zone sizes. The adiabatic, fixed-bed OCM reaction zones are modeled as one-dimensional (1-D) and pseudo-homogeneous. The reactor network simulation model comprises the zone models together with mass and energy balances of mixing nodes at each reaction zone inlet. The optimal settings for design decisions are identified with the use of Simulated Annealing (SA). The development of the simulator and the implementation of the SA search scheme will be presented in detail. OCM reactor design optimization is first performed to maximize C2yield. Then, the optimal relationship between methane conversion and C2selectivity is explored as another example of how reactor optimization is approached. Next, alternative objective functions are formulated incorporating process performance aspects such as product and raw material costs, energy costs, and power and energy requirements for separation. These objective functions are formulated such that only information that can be readily available or estimated during reactor design optimization is considered. Differences in observed OCM reactor designs across objectives will be presented and discussed.",

Methanol is a key vector to fuel a future. And a direct methane-to-methanol conversion holds the promise as a drop-in replacement for the methane reforming, which is highly energy-intensive process.Activation of C-H bond in methane is the key step in the direct methane-to-methanol conversion, which has been demonstrated to benefit from the use of free radicals. Photochemical methane activation offers intriguing and vital opportunities by generating free radicals directly from water and oxygen and thus is promising for large scale fuel production. Such photocatalytic process involves the use of inorganic semiconductor catalysts and noble metals nanoparticles co-catalysts. Despite intensive studies, the photocatalytic methane oxidation faces the challenge of a limited selectivity toward methanol, and the catalytic functions of different noble metal co-catalysts remain largely unexplored.In this talk, on the basis of catalysts design, in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance and kinetic studies, we will discuss the relationship between the role of co-catalysts, the controlled generation of free radicals, and the selectivity toward various liquid products, as well as methane removal.

    "abstract": "AbstractPalladium is an active catalyst for purifying alkene streams but often leads to over-hydrogenation and waste of raw ethylene due to the strong adsorption of ethylene on active sites. Various approaches have been explored to weaken the adsorption energy based on the electronic and geometric effects to enhance ethylene selectivity. However, due to the linear scaling relationships between adsorbates, the activation of acetylene is also severely restricted on palladium sites, resulting in decreased reactivity and high reaction temperature. Moreover, reducible metal oxides such as TiO2, CeO2, and GaCeOxhave been proposed for catalytic hydrogenation of alkynes with intrinsic alkenes selectivity. However, the hydrogenation activity is orders of magnitude lower than Pd-based catalysts due to the sluggish H2dissociation dynamics.Considering the easy H2dissociation on palladium sites, it inspires us to decouple active sites for reactants activation to achieve efficient semi-hydrogenation of alkynes, where H2is activated on palladium sites and C2H2is activated on reducible metal oxides such as TiOx.To this end, we fabricated a Pd-SrTiO3(denoted as Pd-STO) catalyst with well-defined encapsulated Pd clusters using a doping-exsolution strategy based on SrTiO3perovskite. SrTiO3has been reported to exert an excellent ability to transport active hydrogen species at low-temperature. The Pd-STO catalyst takes advantage of the weaker adsorption of intermediate on the partially reduced oxide, TiOx, to enhance the ethylene selectivity. This catalyst shows good performance of 98% conversion and 92% selectivity with a specific activity of 5552 molC2H2-1·molmetal-1·h-1at 100 ℃. The demonstrated catalyst design strategy paves an avenue for breaking the scaling relationship of hydrogenation catalysts by decoupling active sites for the activation of reactants.",

However, catalyst deactivation caused by active metal sintering and carbon poisoning presents significant challenges for practical applications of DRM. To address this, researchers have developed robust metal oxide composite catalysts with strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) properties to enable extended operation with minimal activity loss. Effective catalyst pelletization is also critical to prevent reactor and equipment failure from powder blockages, pressure drop, and surface-active site blockage. Therefore, optimizing catalyst pellets with high conversion efficiency is essential to enhance reactor stability and catalyst lifespan.In this study, a catalyst bead of Ni/Mg/Ce metal oxide composite with a hierarchical porous structure was developed. The as-prepared catalysts were applied for the DRM reaction by adjusting the support component ratio. The optimized catalyst was tested for stability at 750℃for 110 hours to evaluate its reaction stability and pressure drop mitigation.The physicochemical characteristics of the catalyst were analyzed using H2-TPR, XPS, HR-TEM with EDS, and XRD to identify the formation of a Ni/Mg/Ce solid solution, inducing SMSI with well-distributed Ni particles under 20 nm and sufficient surface oxygen for enhanced carbon oxidation. The physical and carbon analysis of the catalyst was performed using FE-SEM with EDS, TGA, and Raman, revealing the distinct carbon generation and unique catalyst surface reconstruction behavior of the hierarchical porous structure.The optimized Ni/Mg/Ce catalyst with a hierarchical porous structure demonstrated enhanced reaction stability and pressure drop mitigation, supported by its free volume and dense-shell structure. The findings suggest potential for the optimized catalyst in industrial-scale DRM and other high-temperature reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe recent push towards sustainable hydrogen that can be produced from natural gas and supported by permanent carbon capture has sparked renewed interest in C–H bond activation of methane. The current catalysts used for this process deactivate easily due to coke formation on the surface of the catalyst. Coke formation is known to be caused by strong binding of CHxintermediates and a net exothermic reaction pathway.A promising catalyst must be able to activate C−H bonds while being able to resist coke formation. Recently, single Ni atoms have been reported to be deposited on titanium nitride (TiN) plasmonic nanoparticles and that the single Ni atoms favorably deposit on N-vacancy sites on the TiN surface. Supported by computational results, single atom catalyst (SAC) formation has been confirmed through experimental TEM imaging and XPS results. Utilizingab initiospin-polarized DFT calculations, the present work shows the simulation of intermediate C–H bond transition states and the energy barriers of the SAC nickel deposited on titanium nitride (Ni-TiN). The highest activation energy of the simulated pathway was found to be 1.10 eV. This finding along with weaker binding to adsorbates and a net endothermic pathway shows that Ni-TiN is expected to resist coke formation on its surface and stay active as a catalyst.AcknowledgmentsAcknowledgment is made to the State Legislative Fund, New Mexico for financial support.

    "abstract": "AbstractIn the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and fine chemical industries, nitrogen functional groups (i.e. nitriles, amines, N-containing rings) are prevalent and serve important functions.1However, the synthesis of these compounds is challenging; they require high temperatures and pressures, are multistep, and often require ammonia as the source of nitrogen,which is a hazardous chemical that is produced through an energy intensive process.1,2Nonthermal plasmas (NTPs) have emerged as an alternative reactive environment comprised of high energy electrons, radicals, ions, and excited species that can perform reactions at lower temperatures and pressures compared to thermal reactions.3In this work, we demonstrate a process that couples N2directly with natural gas (i.e., methane, ethane, and propane) to produce valuable nitrogen-containing liquid products using NTP excitation.Specifically, we have studied reactions between nitrogen and light hydrocarbons under NTP stimulation to form NH3,CxHy, and CxHyNz­­species. In order to simulate a natural gas mixture in the laboratory, a representative mixed feed (CH4/C2H6/C3H8/N2) was fed to the reactor. The observed products varied as a function of gas composition, plasma power, and bulk gas temperature. With nitrogen-rich feeds, the formation of liquid and solid products was observed, and the liquid products were characterized by a variety of analytical techniques to determine how N was incorporated in the diverse product slate. Chain growth (-CH2- and -HCN-) pathways and in situ H2saturation pathways were postulated based on the products identified from electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Further, N/C ratios were determined for each product, showing a range of nitrogen incorporation is possible through control of the reaction conditions. Characterization of the bulk liquid products by ATR-FTIR, XPS, and various NMR techniques show that the nitrogen is being incorporated as nitrile and amine functionalities. Overall, we showcase the ability of NTP stimulation to activate hydrocarbon and nitrogen mixtures for the production of valuable compounds. Ongoing efforts target identification of intermediate species for liquid formation, which can be introduced in the feed in order to improve liquid production rates.References:(1) Ruiz-Castillo, P.; Buchwald, S.

    "abstract": "AbstractNonthermal plasma activation of shale gas components (e.g., methane, ethane, and nitrogen) is a promising yet largely unexplored solution to combat the misuse of excess shale gas from remote well sites. In this process, high energy electrons from renewable resources inelastically collide with light alkanes, resulting in electronic excitation, vibrational excitation, and ultimately C-C or C-H bond dissociation to form a rich mixture of radical species, hydrogen, olefins, and larger hydrocarbons. This product stream can then be combined with a catalyst in a one- or two-stage process to improve overall activity and selectivity to the desired products. However, a significant barrier with this technology is the uncontrolled coke deposition by the plasma, which rapidly deactivates both plasma-phase and catalyst activity. Thus, an understanding of both the composition and spatial distribution of the carbon deposits is required to develop strategies to mitigate unwanted carbon formation. In this body of work, we first seek to understand the chemical and physical processes related to carbon formation by characterizing the structure and composition of the solid products from ethane plasma in the first stage of a two-stage plasma-catalytic system. Using a water-cooled dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor with visual access to the plasma region, microscale carbon structures with macroscopic order were observed for the first time growing perpendicular to the inner electrode along the reactor length. The spacing between microstructures can be controlled by varying applied voltage or feed composition, and comparison with known literature on microdischarge pattern formation in DBDs led to the conclusion that microstructure growth is linked to microdischarge spacing in a pseudo-1D Type-A discharge. Upon addition of N2to the ethane feed, elemental analysis combined with IR and Raman spectroscopy confirm that nitrogen incorporation into both sp2and sp3bonding phases can be controlled by varying N2content in the feed. Lastly, modification of the reactor design led to greater control in the amount of carbon formed. These advances demonstrate the potential of plasma activation for the decarbonization of shale-gas upgrading and provide a platform for continued research into the emerging field of nonoxidative hydrocarbon plasma-catalysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMethane (CH4) is a valuable fuel for power generation and natural gas-powered vehicles, owing to its abundance, and low CO2emissions attributed to the low H/C (4) ratio of CH4. However, CH4emissions have exacerbated concerns about its global warming potential, which is 25 times greater than that of CO2. Thus, there is an immediate need for catalytic materials capable of reducing CH4[1]. Although Pd-supported zeolite catalysts have been reported to reduce CH4emissions effectively in the presence of water [2], the effect of co-cation incorporation in Pd/zeolites is still under-investigated. Herein, the Na/Al molar ratio (x) of 1 wt.% Pd/Nax-SSZ-13(Si/Al=15) was varied from 0 to 1.22. The catalysts were pretreated with 20% O2/Ar (500 ⁰C/20 min) followed by two consecutive CH4oxidation cycles under 1500 ppm CH4, 5% O2, 5% H2O/Ar (200-650oC (5oC/min)). Pd/Na1-SSZ-13(15) achieved 90% CH4 conversion (T90) at 420⁰C and outperformed all other Pd/Nax-SSZ-13(15) catalysts and 1 wt.% Pd/Al2O3for CH4oxidation (Fig. 1(A)). Increases in the Na/Al molar ratio from 0 to 1 over Pd/Nax-SSZ-13(15) led to a decrease in Brønsted acidity and an increase in the amount PdO (31.4 to 106.7 μmol/gcat) (Fig. 1(B)), resulting in improved CH4oxidation activity. Increasing the Na/Al ratio >1 (Pd/Na1.22-SSZ-13(15)) led to a decrease in CH4oxidation activity compared to Pd/Na1-SSZ-13(15) that can be attributed to Na masking PdO sites. Improvements in CH4oxidation performance by other co-cations (e.g., M = Sr, Mg) and the co-cation effect on the CH4oxidation performance of high silica Pd/SSZ-13(60) will also be reported. This work illustrates the role of co-cations in decreasing the Brønsted acidity and promoting PdO formation over Pd/SSZ-13 catalysts with a goal to improve the CH4oxidation performance.",

In this work, we consider the design requirements needed to achieve 10-millisecond gas phase switching of a catalytic reaction system, thus allowing us to access a dynamic operating regime on the timescale of the surface kinetics. We then use residence time distributions and pressure drop measurements to characterize the square wave transient achieved in the capillary microreactors used in this study. Residence time distributions were found to be sensitive to delays in trigger time logging, requiring short response time for gas injection, high sampling frequency for gas concentration and averaging to obtain mean residence time and Peclet number from the open-open boundary dispersion model. The results revealed near plug flow and 10 millisecond residence times at pressures as low as 6 psig. Feed modulation achieved square waveforms at frequencies up to 25 Hz, with a maximum operating frequency of 50 Hz. The reactor is integrated in a gas chromatograph, providing fast MS/FID for analysis of products and temperature programmed oxidation to measure catalyst activity, selectivity, and coking.",

    "abstract": "AbstractReducing limitations for internal molecular diffusion in zeolites is critical to improving catalyst activity and stability for commercial applications such as hydrocarbon cracking and methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) reactions. The intrinsic confined pore networks in zeolite structures give rise to well-defined shape-selectivity, which can result in highly selective products, but oftentimes at the expense of reduced activity and lifetime owing to the large crystal sizes of conventional zeolites that impose mass transport restrictions. For example, zeolites with one-dimensional pores, such as zeolite MTT, are highly selective to propylene in naptha cracking, but they deactivate faster than 2D or 3D analogues due to limited diffusion leading to extensive coking and pore mouth blockage. Such limitations can be overcome via a facile post-synthesis treatment to produce fins, which are small protrusions on external surfaces of seed crystals. This secondary growth technique has been demonstrated for zeolites with 3D (MFI) and 2D (FER) pore networks wherein finned catalysts markedly outperform their parent seeds in MTH and butene isomerization reactions, respectively. Our findings show that molecular diffusion in finned zeolites is faster, resulting in reduced rates of coking and longer catalyst lifetime. Here, we will discuss how this approach can be used to design finned 1D zeolites, using MTT as a prototypical example. These studies are combined with post-synthesis treatment methods aimed to reduce defects in zeolites, thereby improving their catalytic performance (e.g. total turnovers and lifetime) beyond what can be achieved with conventional as-synthesized materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo bridge the so-called propylene gap, propylene production via the cross-metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene is receiving renewed interest. Supported WO3/SiO2catalysts are used commercially to produce propylene however, the activity is often limited due to low dispersion of the active W species. Recently, our group found that doping W-based catalysts with Nb significantly enhances the metathesis activity by creating new and superior active sites, as confirmed by EXAFS, TPR, and ToF-SIMS. In this work, we demonstrate that similar enhancements in metathesis activity are observed in Mo-based catalysts when doped with metals such as Nb or Zr.A series of bimetallic (Mox/My-KIT-6) catalysts were successfully synthesized with variable Mo and dopant metal (M=Nb/Zr/Ta/Hf) loadings using a simple wet impregnation technique. The bimetallic Mo2/Nb1.5-KIT-6 and Mo2/Zr1.5-KIT-6 catalysts displayed enhanced propylene yield (45.5 ± 0.5% and 42.0 ± 0.8%) when compared to Mo2/KIT-6 (37.2 ± 0.3%) under identical reaction conditions. Further, the deconvoluted DR UV-Vis spectra show that compared to Mo2/KIT-6 and Mo2/Zr1.5-KIT-6 catalysts, the Mo2/Nb1.5-KIT-6 catalyst shows a higher ratio of tetrahedral to octahedral MoOxspecies suggesting an increase in the population of the isolated active site precursors (Fig 1b). These results suggest that the addition of Nb or Zr alters Mo coordination yielding additional active sites (MoNbOx) that are more active than their monometallic counterparts, most likely by varying the O=Mo=O bond angle. The influence of metal loadings along with detailed catalyst characterization results (XRD, EXAFS, In situ Py-IR, Raman, TPD, TPR, XPS, MAS NMR), as well as DFT calculations, will be presented to explain the structure-activity relationships.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMethanethiol, commonly referred to as methyl mercaptan, is a type of sulfur-based compound often found in natural gas streams. This compound is responsible for unpleasant odors and can lead to pipeline corrosion. To improve natural gas quality, metal oxides and aluminum silicates have been examined as potential catalysts for removing mercaptan. This study explored the effectiveness of these materials in a fixed-bed reactor with simulated natural gas streams. Catalyst performance in methyl mercaptan removal depends on temperature, pressure, and gas flow rate. The adsorbent/catalysts were thoroughly characterized using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS).The results showed that metal oxides, particularly a commercial catalyst called Select HP, composed mainly of copper, manganese, and zinc oxides, exhibited promising methyl mercaptan removal capabilities. Select HP achieved a breakthrough time of 361 minutes at 75°C, 200 psi, 36 ml/min, and 100 ppm CH3SH. These findings offer valuable insights for developing new catalysts that combine metal oxides to enhance adsorption while minimizing the formation of reaction by-products such as dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) during methyl mercaptan removal.An alumino-silicate (Halloysite Pure) was impregnated with copper, zinc, nickel, magnesium, and manganese oxides to evaluate their impact on removing methyl mercaptan from natural gas. The addition of metal oxides to the alumino-silicate surface resulted in a sulfur capacity of 1.29 gS/gcatalyst at 25°C, 200 psi, 36 ml/min, and 200 ppm methyl mercaptan, while Select HP's sulfur capacity under the same conditions was 0.38 gS/gcatalyst. Future experiments will be conducted at higher temperatures to determine whether the performance of the new UL catalyst improves methyl mercaptan removal at industrial operating temperature ranges.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTailoring the physical properties of advanced functional materials is crucial to ensure their superior performance for relevant applications. Developing suitable interventions in synthesis requires a detailed understanding of their mechanistic growth pathways. Here, we are investigating the industrially relevant zeolite, SSZ-13, used in the selective catalytic reduction and Methanol to Olefin reaction, among others. Tuning the zeolite crystals' polydispersity, size, and morphology has been a significant challenge for efficient catalyst design. We explored a novel synthetic protocol to develop SSZ-13 crystals with desired attributes. The SSZ-13 crystals were synthesized under dynamic conditions by modulating the growth conditions of the mother liquor to produce crystals with varying size ranges and improved dispersity. To establish better control over the dispersity of particles, we investigated the effect of various salts acting as counter ions or stabilizing agents on the growth dynamics of the mother liquor. The zeolite formed without any modifier showed bimodal distribution where the smaller crystals are ~400 nm in dimension and larger crystals are of the order of 6 µm.The new synthesis protocol achieved the monodisperse population resulting in bulk crystals of ~500 nm by adding counter ions. Similarly, increased valency helped us obtain a bigger (~2µm) and yet monodisperse population. With a suitable selection of these stabilizing agents, we modulated particle morphology from cubic shape to polyhedron, which is unique to SSZ-13 synthesis. The use of the synergistic effect of additives further enhanced the potency of the design protocol to achieve a smaller monodisperse particle (~260 nm). Detailed tracking of particle distribution by volume and numbers during crystallization helped us to understand the growth phenomena. To this end, we will showcase the complete library of particles generated using this novel method and mechanistic insights relevant to controlling the polydispersity of crystallites.",

We identify the redox reaction mechanism that is consistent with reported experimental reaction orders, apparent activation energy, reaction rate, and IR/XANES/EXAFS spectroscopic data.

    "abstract": "AbstractAldol condensations are useful in chemical synthesis and have potential for bio-oil upgrading to transportation fuels or platform chemicals. Depending on the reactant(s), controlling selectivity presents a challenge, since various self- and cross-aldol condensation products may form.Further, a side reaction to an olefin and a carboxylic acid (called fission) is attracting interest, as a route for producing isobutene (an important monomer, e.g. for synthetic rubber) via acetone self-condensation.Soluble acid-base catalysts combined with special reagents permit selectivity control, but present the well-known disadvantages of corrosion, waste generation and expensive catalyst recovery. Also, efforts in heterogeneously catalyzed aldol reactions have focused on catalyst stability and activity. Hence, there is a demand for selective, solid catalysts that will make aldol processes more sustainable. This work explores zeolites with different frameworks(MFI, MWW, MOR, BEA and FAU) as catalysts to investigate the effect of microporosityon selectivity. Benzenesulfonic acid serves as a soluble benchmark catalyst devoid of the spatial constraints imparted by zeolite pores. Results obtained for the zeolite-catalyzed cross-aldol reaction between benzaldehyde and diverse ketones (C3 – C7) indicate that the zeolitespromote formation of the fission products. Maximum fission product selectivities were 92% at 88% conversion with the large-pore FAU framework and 67% at 26% conversion with the medium-pore MFI framework. The MOR framework favored the fission pathway; however, it was less active with 30% benzaldehyde conversion and is in this respect comparable to the medium-pore zeolites. The soluble acid catalyst was highly selective to the classical aldol condensation product (Figure 1).Regarding the role of ketone size for selectivity, higher ketones resulted in greater selectivity towards fission products, which suggests an interplay of confinement effects from making the ketone bulkier and electronic effects from the variation of substitution at the alpha carbon.",

In particular, CTH may occur through an indirect “metal hydride route” where the donor dehydrogenates on a metal surface and the surface hydrogen atoms get picked by the acceptor molecule; alternatively, donors may directly transfer hydrogen to the acceptor, especially on Lewis acid catalysts.In this talk, we use FA as a representative hydrogen donor and formaldehyde as a representative hydrogen acceptor to elucidate how hydrogen bonding affects the reaction mechanism for CTH of carbonyl bonds on Cu(111). FA is a promising hydrogen carrier as it is an environmentally friendly by-product from biomass upgrading while formaldehyde is the simplest unsaturated oxygenate. Using dispersion-corrected periodic density functional theory (DFT, PBE-dDSC) calculations and coverage self-consistent mean-field microkinetic modeling, we develop a mechanistic model of this CTH system. We show that direct hydrogen atom transfer between a donor and acceptor is kinetically feasible on transition metal catalysts especially if the donor and the acceptor can interact via hydrogen bonding. Such direct transfer significantly enhances the rate of catalytic hydrogenation (by at least 7 orders of magnitude) while using a hydrogen donor relative to using molecular hydrogen as the hydrogen source. This work, thus, indicates the potential tuning of activity and selectivity of hydrogenation through judicious choice of hydrogen donors.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThermocatalytic routes have several advantages (e.g., high conversion rates, good selectivity, and scalability) and thus are widely used for commercial production of fuels and chemicals. However, today’s thermocatalytic technologies use fossil fuels as a source of energy and produce greenhouse gases that drive global climate change. Therefore, to become low- and zero-carbon emission technologies, these processes need to utilize renewable energy. One way to accomplish this goal is to convert solar energy into heat required to run chemical reactions. Ideally, such solar-thermal systems also need to operate under ambient sunlight (1-sun intensity) to make them suitable for large-scale use. We have therefore designed a solar-thermal flow-through reactor with a multi-layered selective solar absorber. We find that when exposed to natural sunlight, the selective absorber reaches a temperature of 120 °C sufficient to drive an industrially relevant ethylene oligomerization reaction where ethylene is electrochemically derived from CO2electrolysis. Moreover, we demonstrate that a supported nickel catalyst (Ni on SIRAL-30) converts ethylene into C4 hydrocarbons directly from the gas outlet stream of the CO2electrolysis cell. Overall, our work presents a framework to convert greenhouse gases into fuels using CO2, water, and sunlight.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEnantiospecific heterogeneous catalysis is focused on understanding how the structure ofa chiral catalytic surface favors one of the adsorbate enantiomers. Due to the chiral nature of the human enzymes, understanding these chiral interactions is important in the pharmaceutical industry. This work focuses on modeling the enantiospecific decomposition of Tartaric acid over a large range of copper surface orientations. The enantiospecificity is quantified by the difference in the half-times of the decomposition of the two Tartaric acid enantiomers. The data to build this model were collected using multiple Surface Structure Spread Single Crystals (S4C) that expose a continuous distribution of plane orientations across their surface. The goal is to use Machine Learning to gain more insights about the experimental observations and find the surface orientation with optimal enantiospecificity. The model built uses Generalized Coordination Numbers (GCN) descriptors which capture information about the coordination of the atoms on each surface orientation. A linear regression model was used to make predictions about surface orientations that were not tested experimentally, and it identified surfaces such as Cu (93,32,28) and Cu (81,59,47) to be highly enantiospecific. The model suggests regions near the (100)-(111) stepped symmetry plane, with short terraces, and atoms with a high density of atoms with GCN values near 7 contribute to highly enantioselective tartaric acid decomposition. This work offers insight into the origins of highly enantioselective decomposition kinetics as it relates to surface structure, and its prediction capability can be utilized to guide the search and discovery of highly enantioselective surface orientations more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe selective removal of heteroatoms plays a large role in biomass conversion (O, N removal), petroleum refining (S removal), wastewater treatment (Cl removal), and pharmaceutical syntheses (O, N, Cl removal). Kinetic and density functional theory (DFT) studies have shown that in hydrogenolysis of saturated CH3XHnmolecules (X = C, N, O, S, Cl) on group 8–11 transition metals, the heteroatom and metal identities impact the extent of dehydrogenation prior to the C–X cleavage transition state (ACS Catal.(2020) p.5086). Free energy barriers indicate that C–X activations on group 8–10 transition metals typically occur after removing two H atoms from the carbon atom regardless of heteroatom identity. The dehydrogenation of –NH2prior to C–N activation varied significantly across metals, while the dehydrogenation of –OH was rare and dehydrogenation of –SH was universal. We have since extended previous study to assess the mechanisms that activate Ph–X in functionalized aromatic species, and consider the possibility of dehydrogenations (from the ring or X-group) prior to Ph–X cleavage. Experimental kinetic data (U. Maine) examining chlorobenzene hydrogenolysis and our theoretical data on Pd(111) conclude that C–Cl cleavage in chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl) occurs without any preceding dehydrogenation of C6H5Cl. Broadly, we saw that dehydrogenation of the ring can lead to lower-barrier transition states while identity of the “leaving group” remained consistent with our earlier work on CH3XHn­; for example, toluene prefers to cleave to form CH*, phenol to form OH*, benzenethiol to form S*. In general, understanding the mechanisms of heteroatom removal from simple organic molecules furthers fundamental insight into hydrogenolysis of more complex organic molecules.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAlkali metal incorporation has been adopted to manipulate the performance of solid acid catalysts, with previous reports that adding alkali metal cation could either decrease catalytic activity through active sites blockage, or introduce new catalytic capability via formation of basic sites. Despite numerous investigations, myths still exist on the nature of the alkali-modified active sites. Herein, we systematically investigate the catalytic active sites over unmodified zirconia (ZrO2) and sodium-doped zirconia (Na-ZrO2) through surface characterizations and kinetic measurement. A series of tetragonal ZrO2and Na-ZrO2catalysts with varying Na contents were synthesized, and pyridine FT-IR measurement showed only Lewis acid sites present on these catalysts. Using isopropanol as probe molecule for kinetic analysis, propene and acetone were the major products under reaction conditions, through dehydration and dehydrogenation of isopropanol. Decreased dehydration rate and increased dehydrogenation rate were observed with increasing Na content incorporated. Combination of activation energy measurement (Figure 1Aand1B)and quantitative TPSR indicates that the trend of dehydration/dehydrogenation rates with increasing Na content is not only due to changes in corresponding active site densities (more dehydrogenation sites and less dehydration sites), but also due to changes in reaction barriers resulting from the sodium present. Raman characterization revealed the formation of NaHCO3/Na2CO3surface layer over Na-ZrO2catalysts, likely due to the reaction between incorporated Na with CO2and water in air, which contributes to the formation of basic active sites for acetone synthesis. Additionally, co-feeding water with isopropanol decreased propene and acetone rates of formation over all catalysts reversibly, with dehydration more inhibited than dehydrogenation and such discrepancy increases at higher Na content (Figure 1C).",

    "abstract": "AbstractJacketed stirred tank reactors (STRs) are commonly used in manufacturing pharmaceuticals and speciality chemicals. Often complex chemical reactions are used in the production of such chemicals, which are particularly sensitive to temperature changes. Therefore, accurate heat transfer (HT) models are required to predict and control the temporal process temperature profile.The traditional approach for modelling the change in the process temperature in STRs is known as the reduced model (Equation (1)). A detailed HT model (Equation (2)) was developed by Johnson et al. (2021), which includes: the variation of jacket inlet temperature; non-uniformity in the jacket fluid temperature; heat losses from the jacket and ullage region and the thermal inertia of the vessel and contents. For this work, the advanced model was further extended to consider chemical reactions and the associated heat generation/consumption and coupled with the reaction kinetics in Equation (3). The esterification reaction (R1) investigated by Bosch et al. (2004) was used as a case study to test the performance of the advanced model. The reaction was conducted in a 200 L jacketed STR with at a constant jacket temperature (70.16 °C). Bosch et al. reported only the overall coefficient,(UA)p, for heat transfer between the jacket and process fluids. The other HT coefficients associated with heat losses ((UA)plossand(UA)jloss) required in this advanced model are absent. However, Equation (2) can be reduced to Equation (1) by setting these coefficients to zero.Figure 1 presents the process temperature profiles which were recorded experimentally and predicted using Equation (1) by Bosch et al. (2004) and the new advanced HT model neglecting heat losses. It validates the new model as the curves from both models lie close together. However, both models over predict the temperature peak and this may be improved if heat losses could be accounted for.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAldol condensation of mixtures of acetaldehyde, acetone and butanone was investigated over a powder TiO2catalyst as a strategy for coupling mixtures of light oxygenates generated from biomass pyrolysis into heavier, higher-value products. Aldol condensation reactions were performed for single component, binary and ternary mixtures of the three reactants. Pathways for major reaction products generated at industrially relevant reaction temperatures (300 - 400°C) were identified by comparing the product mixtures for each of the ternary, binary, and pure-component reactions. Selectivity to heavier C5+condensation products was high (>80%) at all temperatures investigated, but undesirable lighter hydrocarbons, formed through cracking of larger condensation products, were also produced during each condensation reaction. The selectivity to both heavier C5+and light hydrocarbon products were found to increase with reaction temperature as well as the average molecular weight of the reactant feed stream. Moderate temperatures (350°C) were found to provide an optimal balance of high conversion and low yield to light hydrocarbon side products.To provide further understanding into the mechanisms driving these reactivity trends, kinetics for single component and binary reaction mixture reactions were measured at relatively low reaction temperatures (150 – 200°C) and differential conversion to isolate how condensation of mixed streams differed from single-component condensation. Results from kinetic and temperature programmed desorption experiments suggested that acetaldehyde out-competed larger carbonyl compounds for access to active sites. Additionally, trends in product stream selectivity for the acetaldehyde and acetone mixed feed reaction show that acetaldehyde is preferentially activated as an electrophile, interacting with nucleophilic forms of adsorbed acetaldehyde and acetone.Beyond simply lowering the rate via site blocking, the presence of acetaldehyde in the mixture increased the apparent activation barriers and orders for acetone condensation. These changes reflect an unexpected surface interaction between different carbonyl compounds on the catalyst surface.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe selective oxidation of benzylic sp3C-H bonds is an important class of functional group transformation of organic synthesis, and its aldehydes and ketones products are widely used in natural products, agricultural chemistry, fine chemicals and other fields. In contrast to traditional thermal reactions, photocatalytic strategy has great benefits for the environment through the utilization of clean energy. Inspired by the potential of photocatalysis, several precious metal complexes and elaborate organic dyes have been reported for the selective oxidation of alcohols. Nevertheless, the availability and limited reactivity of these photocatalysts hinder their application. Therefore, it is important and of great research significance to explore an environmentally friendly, mild and efficient benzylic sp3C-H bonds selective oxidation.Based on the previous work, a photocatalytic strategy via disulfide-mediated selective oxidation of alcohols was developed. Green and efficient oxidation can be realized under light irradiation, utilizing phenyl disulfides as the photocatalyst, 1-phenethyl ethanol as the template substrate, molecular oxygen as the oxidant. A variety of primary and secondary alcohols were converted into the corresponding aldehydes or ketones. The functional groups were well tolerated, with a maximum yield of 91% at room temperature with 3 hours of light irradiation. The reaction efficiency could be increased even further by combining a continuous-flow strategy. 1-Phenylethanol can be oxidized more efficiently and 98% yields can be obtained at the residence time of 4.3 min, so the efficiency of the reaction was improved by a factor of nearly forty. Relevant mechanistic studies have also been achieved to determine the role of oxygen and disulfides for this oxidation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAs a successful synthesis method of epoxides, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-propylene oxide (HPPO) process has gathered interest utilizing Ti-incorporated zeolites and organic solvents. However, solvent structures and interactions between reactive species that affect epoxidation chemistry within confined pores have not been extensively understood. Here, we offer an insight into the role of solvent and its organization on the vapor-phase alkene epoxidation by demonstrating that saturating micropores with gaseous acetonitrile (CH3CN) leads to significant increases in catalytic rates and selectivities through noncovalent interactions.We conducted 1-hexene (C6H12) epoxidation with vaporized H2O2over Ti-BEA with varying intrapore CH3CN densities in the proximity of active sites. Combined analyses ofin situinfrared spectroscopy and dynamic vapor sorption show that zeolite pores spontaneously condense gaseous CH3CN in the proximity of active sites, and its density increases with pore silanol ((SiOH)x) densities (“hydrophilicity”) and partial pressures. Turnover rates of C6H12epoxidation and the primary product (1,2-epoxyhexane, C6H12O) selectivity increase monotonically by 20-fold and 2-fold as intrapore CH3CN density increases, respectively. Changes in rate and selectivity respond more sensitively to CH3CN within hydrophilic pores than hydrophobic counterparts in a given reaction condition. Apparent activation enthalpy and entropy increase by 11 kJ∙mol-1and 48 J∙mol-1∙K-1as a single value function of CH3CN density (0.4-10 molecules∙(unit cell)-1) across all Ti-BEA catalysts with varying (SiOH)xdensities. This systematic increase reflects the entropic stabilization that leads to concomitant changes in rates and selectivities, due to the more significant reorganization of CH3CN while accommodating transition states in CH3CN-saturated pores than under solvent-free conditions.In situinfrared spectra corroborate the reorganized intrapore CH3CN in the presence of products (C6H12O) adsorbed into the pores, and its magnitude depends on pore (SiOH)xdensities. These findings demonstrate the effects of condensed solvents on catalytic rates and selectivities, even without the presence of a saturated liquid-phase.",

This is typically performed on metal catalysts, such as Pt or Ru, in the presence of H2. The composition and structure of metal catalysts critically influences reaction rate and product selectivity. Pt is generally very active for carbonyl hydrogenation, and recent work shows that its performance can be enhanced by combining it with base, oxophilic metals, like Sn.

    "abstract": "AbstractFischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is an important process that converts syngas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) to produce fuels and chemicals. In this scenario, cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts show many benefits such as high activity, low water–gas shift activity and they are used in industrial applications. In heterogeneous catalysis, the support, the promoters, the preparation of the catalyst, and the reaction conditions are key factors that can affect the catalytic performance. SiO₂, used as support for cobalt catalysts shows a weaker metal-support interaction, and for this reason, it is commonly used in Co catalysts. A challenge is in developing active and stable catalysts with high selectivity since many catalysts suffer from deactivation, especially at high conversions where steam oxidizes Co to a less active surface state.The use of promoters in Co/SiO₂ can enhance the catalytic performance of cobalt catalysts to FTS. Noble metals such as platinum are responsible for contributing to a higher degree of reduction of cobalt oxide at a lower temperature. Furthermore, the promotion of Co/SiO₂ with Mn can enhance the selectivity of C₅+ products and decrease the methane yields.This study aims to determine the effects of the synergic promotion of Co/SiO₂ by manganese and platinum in the activity, selectivity, and stability of this FTS catalyst. Catalyst preparation is done by incipient wetness impregnation and the variables pressure, temperature, and H₂/CO molar feed ratio on the catalytic performance are evaluated.

Earlier contributions by others have made significant advancements in the utilization of O3within microreactor and continuous flow platforms. However, the main limitation of many of these examples is that the achieved throughput is low.We show that high-yielding and highly selective ozonolysis reactions have been developed within a dedicated microreactor system ensuring exquisite control over mass and heat transfer for these very fast gas-liquid transformations.1The system utilized a Modular MicroReaction System (MMRS) equipped with a FlowPlate Lab (LL mixing structure, 357 µL, nominal channel width 0.2 mm, Hastelloy C22). An ozone module from ThalesNano was utilized for the in-situ generation of O3from pure O2, and for the controlled introduction of the gas feed into the reactor plate to generate an annular flow regime. The optimization of the reaction conditions for the ozonolysis of cyclohexene to hexanedial, and thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulfoxide is presented. Cyclohexene is transformed to hexanedial in 94% yield at 0 °C within 1.7 seconds. In a similar fashion, the ozonolysis of thioanisole was achieved in 99% yield at 0 °C within <1 second.

    "abstract": "AbstractCurrently, there is a heightened awareness regarding air pollution, which has led to more stringent regulations on air pollutants. Air pollution is predominantly caused by NOxand CO, which comprise around 45% of total air pollutants in South Korea. These pollutants are largely emitted by fuel combustion, including power plants. To comply with the emission regulations, abatement technologies such as selective catalytic reduction with NH3(NH3-SCR) and catalytic oxidation of CO are used to reduce the emission of air pollutants. While some catalysts have been developed to remove both NOxand CO simultaneously, their limited operating temperature range and poor moisture resistance pose significant challenges.In this study, we prepared the noble metal-promoted V-W/TiO2catalysts and investigated the possibility of simultaneous removal of CO and NOxin one catalyst, and as a result, the Pd was considered as the suitable promoter. In the next step, Pd concentration on the catalyst was optimized. It was confirmed that the 0.3 wt% Pd-doped V-W-0.3Pd/Ti catalyst could remove NOxand CO in a wide temperature range from 230 °C to 369 °C (>90% DeNOxand CO removal efficiency simultaneously).

    "abstract": "AbstractPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a kind of pervasive, persistent, and harmful water contaminant that calls for effective degradation methods. We worked with our collaborators and reported that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising photocatalyst for PFOA degradation under UVC illumination, with an activity ~2x higher than TiO2(see Environ. Sci. Technol. Lett. 2020, 7, 8, 613–619). By applying density functional theory (DFT), we investigated the favorability of the first photo-oxidation step of PFOA on hBN surface: CnF2n+1COO-+ h+→ CnF2n+1• + CO2. The thermodynamic feasibility of the oxidation reaction was confirmed by the lower computed valence band position of hBN than the oxidation potential of deprotonated PFOA. We further computed the free energy and activation barrier of the surface reaction and found that the PFOA photo-oxidation is exothermic with a moderate barrier over illuminated hBN. The kinetic feasibility of the reaction was further confirmed by computing the electron transfer rate between the molecule and hBN surface using Marcus theory. To understand the excellent performance of the hBN with wide bandgap under UVC light, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to characterize the hBN surface defects. We identified nitrogen-boron substitutional defect (NB), oxygen-at-nitrogen-site substitutions (ON),as well as edge defects on the hBN material used in the experiment. The density of states analysis of the defective surface models suggests that the defects do not interfere with the oxidation reaction. Furthermore, N­Bdefects introduce mid-gap states that enable the UVC light absorption and enhance charge carrier separation. Therefore, we propose that introducing more NBdefects is a promising strategy to enhance the photocatalytic degradation performance of hBN. Our work sets the theoretical basis for the photocatalyst design for PFOA removal in water treatment.",

The influence of functional groups of the fuels such as alcohols and their partial combustion products (aldehydes), polyoxymethylene ethers, esters, alkanes and aromatics on the catalyst light-off temperature was investigated. The effect of these net-zero carbon fuels on other criterial pollutants such as CO and NOx were also studied.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPerfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are unique in nature because of their strong C − F bonds (485 kJ/mol) which make them intractable towards thermal, chemical, and biological degradation1–2. Due to their persistent nature, they have been identified as organic pollutants of significant concern with potential hazardous effect to environment, wildlife, and human beings. Despite the rapid advances, the current treatment technologies for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances removal are not yet practical due to limited effectiveness, convenience, and high operational costs.Electrochemical adsorption onto an electrode surface and subsequent (electro)catalytic reductive defluorination are promising alternatives for the removal and destruction (respectively) of PFAS from water and wastewater. However, little is known about the thermodynamics of PFAS binding or of the mechanism of the defluorination.In this work cyclic voltammetry is used to electrochemically measure the adsorption strength of different perfluoro-alkyl acids with increasing (perfluoroalkyl) chain-length on a Pt (111) single crystal electrode. By deconvoluting cyclic voltammograms further information is extracted to demonstrate how binding energy, adsorption type (chemisorption vs physisorption ratio) and orientation (lying flat or upright on the surface) varies with increasing chain-length for these PFAS molecules. The effects of PFAS concentration and electrolyte pH are additionally considered. By understanding the binding strength, mechanism, and configuration of these PFAS molecules as a function of their size and concentration as well as electrolyte pH, process conditions that would enable the PFAS removal process have been identified. Further, as adsorption is (likely) the first step in reductive defluorination, we can also begin to understand the mechanism of this complex reaction.Reference:Chen, Z.et al.Efficient Reductive Destruction of Perfluoroalkyl Substances under Self-Assembled Micelle Confinement.Environ Sci Technol54, 5178–5185 (2020).Duchesne, A.

    "abstract": "AbstractHerein, we report the synthesis and catalytic performance of bi-metallic supported catalyst of NiCo/SiO2for methane dry reforming (MDR). The catalysts were synthesized using two different synthesis methods; combustion synthesis and physical-mixing methods, to evaluate the effect of catalyst preparation technique on dry reforming performance. In the physically mixed method, the precursors nickel-nitrate and cobalt-nitrate are dissolved in water and combusted in presence of glycine and the resulted powders are mixed with silica; whereas in the solution combustion synthesis the precursors are dissolved in silica dispersed water and combusted to get the supported catalyst. The catalysts are then calcined at 600oC for an hour and used for MDR stability tests at 700oC. The 10 wt.% NiCo/SiO2-PM catalyst shows CH4conversion drop from 48% to 44%, while CO2conversion change from 61% to 56% in 20h TOS. The combustion synthesized catalyst shows exceptionally higher conversion of both CH4and CO2for 70 h TOS. The CH4conversion changed from 93% to 87%, and CO2decreased from 96 % and 90%. Based on our detailed analysis (SEM, TEM, NAP-XPS, XAS (XANES and EXAFS), a strong metal-support interaction is found in CM catalyst. The NAP-XAS analysis shows how the surface composition and oxidation states change in presence of reactive gases.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon nanotubes (CNT) possess astounding physical properties that make them ideal materials for a variety of industrial products. Yet, the expenses associated with CNT production and purification have prevented widespread incorporation of CNTs into many fields. That cost can be drastically reduced if CNTs can be grown in such high yields that the catalyst may remain among the nanotubes as a minor impurity that does not warrant costly purification. The ideal catalyst support for this is vermiculite, a cheap naturally occurring clay that consists of two-dimensional nanosheets, while the ideal catalyst metal is iron, a common and non-toxic metal. Exfoliation of vermiculite with species such as citric acid (CA) and dodecyltrimethylammoniumbromide (DTAB) can dramatically increase the surface area of the support and consequently CNT yields. Figure 1a shows effect of exfoliants, and subsequent exfoliations, to dramatically increase carbon nanotube yields via chemical vapor deposition in a fluidized bed reactor. Figure 1b shows on-line monitoring of hydrogen production via a mass spectrometer, which provides insight to the kinetics of carbon nucleation, CNT growth, and catalyst deactivation to better understand the mechanisms at play during the reaction. Catalyst deactivation was modified by including water as a reactant, which has been shown to increase catalyst lifetime by decreasing carbon concentration on the catalyst surface. Additionally, the procedure was studied with both ethylene and methane. These results were fit to a kinetic model to compare the effects of nanotube growth and catalyst deactivation to design a catalyst that yields over 25 grams of CNT per gram of catalyst, which surpasses many yields presented in literature.Figure 1a.

    "abstract": "AbstractAn effective way to mitigate the negative effect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is by converting them to valuable products. Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is an effective technique that converts the primary GHGs, CO2and CH4to syngas (H2+CO), facilitated by catalysts.For decades, the focus on DRM is on catalyst development, the design of highly active and stable catalyst to combat the problem of coke formation that causes deactivation, especially when noble-metal catalysts (Ni, Co) were used. Therefore, materials like metal-organic framework (MOF) have gained attention in recent years for catalyst development. MOFs are highly porous materials composed of well-ordered structures of metal ions affixed by organic linkers. Due to their exceptional morphological characteristics, high surface area, flexible design, MOFs can serve as templates and precursors to design highly dispersed nano-porous materials.In this work, a novel bimetallic Ni-Ce MOF-derived catalyst was synthesized via a facile solvothermal method, and the catalyst active site was activated under nitrogen atmosphere at 5000C for 2 h. Catalysts with varying nickel to ceria ratio were prepared, and their properties were determined via N2adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analyzer, and hydrogen temperature programmed reduction analyses.Results obtained showed high stability for all catalysts after 24 h and 120 h of DRM reaction at 7000C. Interestingly, catalyst containing 100% nickel without cerium exhibited great stability and CO2and CH4conversion of 80% and 68% respectively, with an average particle size of 10 nm. However, the addition of 60% cerium improved the catalyst performance. The average particle size reduced to 2 nm, H2/CO ratio of 0.83 with negligible coke formed and CO2and CH4conversion of 87% and 75% respectively.The results were convincing for the design of a highly stable catalyst for DRM process.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn the past, many processes viz. impregnation, precipitation, colloidal, and atomic layer deposition have been put into practice for the synthesis of metal (M) or metal oxide (MOx) over support materials. Since most of these methods involve liquid-solid phase interactions, poor metal-support interaction may lead to random M/MOx loading and agglomerations. Overcoming the drawbacks of the existing methods, the present study aims to develop ceria-supported M/MOx (M=3d group transition metals) catalysts via onepot chemical vapor deposition (OP-CVD) approach hypothesizing different metal deposition pathway via gas-support actions. Simple procedures, uniform distribution of M/MOx from the gas phase synthesis, and economic feasibility were the main motivation behind building the OP-CVD technique. The synthesis process involves three basic steps: (i)premixing; (ii)vaporization/dispersion; and (iii)decomposition as shown in Fig.1(a). Unique organometallic precursors for each metal were studied for its structure and chemical properties. Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis was performed to understand the thermal effects and further determine the synthesis conditions. The prepared catalysts were characterized using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, BET, ICP-MS, STEM-EDS (Fig.1(b)) and TEM to understand its physicochemical properties. Improved characteristics via the OP-CVD method proves that selecting an appropriate organometallic precursor and favorable synthesis conditions make this catalyst designing approach simple and efficient, corroborating its vast future scope.AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge funding support from: National Science Foundation (NSF-CBET2050824) and National Science Foundation (NSF CHE 2102299).

    "abstract": "AbstractThe objective of the work is to design a Ni-Fe-La catalyst for dry reforming of methane utilizing CO2. A modified constant pH co-precipitation technique was used to prepare catalyst with mesoporous pore structure. The optimization of the catalyst composition is provided by Taguchi’s L16 design and multi-parameter response optimization approach. The control parameters for an optimization investigation comprise Ni as primary active (6-24 wt. %), Fe as second metal (0-9 wt.%), La2O2as a promoter to the catalyst (0-24 wt.%), and rest γ-alumina as catalyst support (52-94 wt.%). The optimized catalyst was thoroughly characterized by different chemical and analytical methods. It is found that the reforming catalyst quality, measured by reaction conversion, H2/CO ratio, and deactivation percentage has significantly increased since the basic testing. The dry reforming catalyst's sustainable activity was mainly determined by the Fe content (wt.%), followed by the Ni metal content and La2O3. The catalyst exhibited excellent stability with nearly 90% CH4conversion, and it was free of any coke deposition in 100 h of time on stream study. The improved synthesis technique yields a catalyst with enhanced physicochemical properties, supporting high activity and stability in dry reforming operations.",

I will discuss our efforts on the synthesis, stability, and catalytic activity of OICs prepared by electrochemical methods at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Our strategies include the use of electrochemically induced phase transformations which enables us to convert a base metal rich alloy to an OIC richer in nobler metal by removal of the base metal, and the direct production of OIC materials by electrochemical deposition. We will also discuss how we leverage the atomically precise configuration of atoms within OICs to reveal detailed insights into how a material’s structure regulates its electrochemical properties.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe catalytic properties of the supported nanoparticles are widely studied. The interface between the substrate and NPs plays an important role in determining the catalytic pathway. Recent studies have shown that the “active” sites participating in catalysis reactions such as Pt NPs in water‐gas shift reactions are on the interface of the support and NP. While there are multiple studies focused on the identification of appropriate support, much less emphasis has been given towards the tunability of the support-nanoparticle interface.A novel approach of Catalytic condenser allows dynamic changes in the electronic state of the catalyst, resulting in charge accumulation and depletion at the active sites, forcing the reaction pathway in a specific direction.[1] The charge density in these nanoparticles can be altered based on the support used for these nanoparticles. Such an approach presents the potential to improve the NP catalytic performance beyond the Sabatier optimum.We utilized a model Pt NP-TiO2 ultra-thin films a model 0D-2D hybrid nanocatalyst system for systematically studying their interfacial dynamics and tuning the active sites of Pt nanoparticles using this architecture. The atomic layer deposition of the ultrathin TiO2 layer allows the deposition of 2D-like continuous TiO2 support layers on various surfaces which can then be further functionalized by controlled deposition of Pt nanoparticles. We leverage this hybrid system for conducting a correlative study of the catalysis using a wide range of in-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques such as low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) with water-gas shift reaction activity studies elucidating the role of “active” sites.[1] Onn, T.

Despite the importance of surface hydroxyls in broader material applications, quantitative measurements of surface acid−base properties are not regularly reported. Here, we describe direct methods to quantify fundamental properties of surface hydroxyls on several titania- and alumina-based supports. Comparing commercially available anatase, rutile, P25, and P90 titania, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that the total surface hydroxyl density varied by a factor of 2, and each surface hydroxyl is associated with approximately one weakly adsorbed water molecule. Proton-exchange site densities, determined at 25 °C with slurry acid−base titrations, led to several conclusions: (i) the intrinsic acidity/basicity of surface hydroxyls were similar regardless of the titania source; (ii) differences in the surface isoelectric point (IEP) were primarily attributable to differences in the surface concentration of acid and base sites; (iii) rutile has a higher surface concentration of basic hydroxyls, leading to a higher IEP; and (iv) P25 and P90 titania have slightly higher surface concentrationsof acidic hydroxyls relative to anatase or rutile. Temperature effects on surface acid−base properties are rarely reported yet are significant: from 5 to 65 °C, IEP values change by roughly one pH unit. The IEP changes were associated with large changes to the intrinsic acid−base equilibrium constants over this temperature range, rather than changes in the composition or concentration of the surface sites.",

    "abstract": "AbstractZSM-5 is a medium-pore silica-rich zeolite requiring high crystallization temperatures (423-473 K) and alkaline pH (>11) for synthesis. Acid sites in zeolite ZSM-5 are responsible for numerous reactions including conversion of methanol to gasoline/olefins and paraffin isomerization, among others. Also, shape-selective catalysis in zeolites is achievable via modulation of crystal size and morphology to enhance exposure of certain crystal facets using zeolite growth modifiers. Thus, tuning zeolite acidity along with crystal morphology is an interesting proposition for catalytic efficiency. Here, we present a novel approach to synthesizing ZSM-5 with controllable morphology and acidity. ZSM-5 was synthesized using a hydrothermal method in which the role of effective charge density of modifiers in tuning the morphology and acidity of zeolite was investigated in detail.Electron microscopy revealed that the use of modifiers has a limited impact on the size of crystals, but has a significant effect on crystal morphology. Conventional ZSM-5 crystals have twinned boat morphology with an average size of ~1.5 μm. ZSM-5 synthesized in presence of charged modifiers resulted in varying crystal sizes (1-2 µm) and morphological attributes depicting enhanced basal plane (higher c-axis growth), appearance of facets relevant to reaction studies, and higher b-axis growth. AFM studies on the as-synthesized zeolite helped explore the underlying growth mechanisms in presence of different modifiers. Further, modifiers were able to significantly increase Bronsted acid sites (IR band at 1548 cm-1) from 104 μmol gm-1(control) to 198 μmol gm-1(modified) in ZSM-5. A careful selection of modifiers also helped us to modulate extra-framework Aluminum sites, increase Lewis acidic character and reduce the H-bonded acid sites by half.Overall, these observations provided unprecedented insights into the critical role of growth modifiers on crystal morphology and acid characteristics (effected by Aluminum speciation in growth solution) and thereby the catalytic potential of these as-synthesized zeolite.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe use of Photocatalysis with semiconductor materials has gained significant attention for its potential to address clean energy and environmental issues by utilizing renewable solar energy. The main challenge in practical use is the development of efficient photocatalyst that function well under solar radiation. An ideal semiconductor photocatalyst should be eco-friendly, inexpensive, stable, and have band edges that are suitable for the targeted reaction and correctly positioned to absorb visible light, thus utilizing the main component of the solar spectrum. This study reports that the novel binary Z-scheme g-C3N4@NiFe-LDH heterostructure photocatalyst were simply prepared by loading well-dispersed g-C3N4 nanosheets on the surface of NiFe-LDH precursor via the hydrothermal synthesis process. Then the prepared photocatalyst was decorated with Ag nanoparticles using photoreduction method. The morphologic structure, chemical composition, optical properties and surface area of the as-prepared nanocomposites were clearly characterized by using XRD, SEM, TEM, UV–Vis DRS, XPS and N2 adsorption–desorption techniques. In the photocatalytic degradation experiments, it can be seen that the optimal Ag decorated g-C3N4@NiFe-LDH nanocomposites can achieve the highest degradation efficiency (99%) for Methylene Blue within 120 min under visible light irradiation, and the corresponding pseudo-first-order. This enhanced photocatalytic efficiency was primarily attributed to the rapid charge transfer at the Ag/LDH/g-C3N4 interfaces and the surface Plasmon resonance of the Ag nanoparticles, which improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and enhances optical absorption. These findings are expected to provide new insights into the design and construction of efficient visible-light-driven photocatalyst for applications in solar energy conversion and environmental remediation.",

Rimer*Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, Texas 77204*jrimer@central.uh.eduHierarchical zeolites contain highly interconnected networks of zeolite micropores combined with mesopores and/or macropores. Interest in these materials stems from the higher reaction rates, improved selectivity, resistance to deactivation, and novel adsorption behavior they exhibit in comparison to conventional zeolites containing only micropores. Among the synthesis approaches used to achieve hierarchical zeolites, the introduction of repetitive branching by rotational intergrowths holds significant promise for developing a new class of industrial catalysts. Advancements in this area of research are becoming even more commercially viable owing to the design of facile, economic synthesis approaches that require a single step and in many instances the use of simple organic structure-directing agents or additives.Among zeolite intergrowths reported in literature, faujasite-based materials have attracted considerable attention due to their superior catalytic properties for a wide variety of (petro)chemical processes. Here, we will discuss recent progress in the preparation of faujasite-based hierarchical materials using one-step synthesis protocols where unique morphologies are achieved through the judicious selection of structure-directing agents. Examples include FAU-EMT and FAU-AEI intergrowths where combinations of inorganics and organics can lead to house-of-cards nanosheet architecture. These atypical morphologies improve diffusion properties, which improves their performance in catalytic reactions. We will also discuss unique organics used to direct zeolites with unusual physicochemical properties, such as nanosheets (< 50 nm thickness) of 3-dimensional pore zeolites. Our findings reveal that these materials exhibit improved mass transport properties compared to materials obtained by more conventional synthesis protocols.",

This work is first of its kind to report the dispersed flow with ATPS by using milli-channel pertaining low capillary number. We have shown how the advantages of both segmented flow for their mixing characteristics and ATPS for their eco-friendly biocompatibility can be exploited together. We report for the first time the continuous synthesis and separation of silver nanoparticles using ATPS as shown in Figure 1. Polyethylene glycol 6000 and tri-sodium citrate at high concentrations was used to form ATPS. We investigated six different operating procedure based on the occurrence of mass transfer process (ATPS formation) after, during and before the reaction (synthesis) in both batch and continuous mode of synthesis. The physico-chemical properties of the nanoparticle obtained from each procedure characterized using optical spectrophotometer and electron microscopy was compared. Continuous mode of operation resulted in shape-controlled synthesis of nanoparticle compared to batch process. Among all the synthesis procedure investigated, use of continuous single-phase flow with pure PEG as reducing agent resulted in sharp LSPR indicating narrow particle size distribution and smaller particle sizes (< 30 nm). Use of dispersed flow in continuous mode eliminated the additional downstream step required for nanoparticle separation. The present work for synthesizing nanoparticles in the ATPS using continuous process opens up a new scope for one-step synthesis and separation of nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSub-nanometric clusters of transition metal (TM) atoms (usually < 13 atoms) have demonstrated remarkable catalytic activities for several reactions,including low temperature CO oxidation, propylene epoxidation,and oxidation of aldehydes. However, as these nanoclusters (NCs) are not thermodynamically stable, significant catalyst deactivation due to sintering is often observed over time. One approach for overcoming these limitations relies on stabilizing the NCs within the pores of a zeolite. Although several experimental studies have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach, the atomistic processes associated with catalyst deactivation remain under-explored. Specifically, while density functional theory (DFT) is routinely used to study surface reactions, modeling the fluxionality of zeolite-confined transition metals (denoted as TM@zeolite) remains challenging. Here, using Au@LTA as a prototypical example, we show that graph neural network-based machine learning potentials (GNN-MLPs) can be used to investigate the size, shape, and dynamics of Au NCs. The PaiNN-based model is developed usingab-initiomolecular dynamics (AIMD) data that span various NC sizes (1 – 10 atoms) and ten zeolite topologies. Furthermore, as traditional nudged elastic band methods do not capture the fluxionality of the NCs, we have used enhanced sampling techniques (e.g., metadynamics and the weighted ensemble method) to calculate the free energy barriers of diffusion within the zeolite pores. This work highlights the growing relevance of MLPs in describing phenomena that remain currently intractable using DFT. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate the rational design of TM@zeolite catalysts for industrially relevant reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHeterogeneous catalysis underpins many important chemical technologies. It is typically very expensive or generally infeasible to run experiments at all conditions of interest so it is useful to be able to generate microkinetic models to describe chemistry without the need for specific experiments. However, these microkinetic models require estimation of many important thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. In particular, at high coverages adsorbates and saddle points have significant energetic interactions with adjacent adsorbates that affect both thermochemistry and kinetics. While computational methods exist for accounting for these coverage dependent effects they tend to be highly expensive and specific to the adsorbates involved. We present a tool for predicting the energetics of arbitrary inter-adsorbate interactions. We generated a dataset of optimized geometries of saddle points for a diverse set of reactions interacting with a variety of co-adsorbates. Mapping these structures into 2D we are able to train a subgraph isomorphic decision tree (SIDT) to predict interactions between arbitrary adjacent adsorbates. We demonstrate the accuracy of the generated SIDT and discuss the limitations of the approach.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRough estimations suggest that a typical catalytic reaction optimization could have a total reaction space of up to52 million different possible combinations.Traditional methods are not well-suited for the optimization of multiple reaction parameters simultaneously, and as a consequence, optimization campaigns are often lengthy, expensive, and wasteful, requiring multiple rounds of experimentation and forcing scientists to rely heavily on intuition and previous experience. Thus making it a very challenging task for beginners and almost impossible for experienced researchers to know how efficient their optimizations truly are. SuntheticsML is an online platform specifically designed to address these challenges and help R&D scientists optimize catalytic reactions with the help of proprietary machine-learning algorithms based on Bayesian optimization (BO).Bayesian optimization is a probabilistic approach that uses Bayesian inference to model the underlying function being optimized. While BO has shown promising results for numerical variables, it is less effective for categorical variables. Categorical features significantly increase dimensionality in optimization approaches given that every variable (e.g., solvent) may have different possible values (e.g., ethanol, methanol, toluene), and typical optimization approaches (i.e., one hot encoding) rely on introducing a new dimension to the optimization for each categorical value. In other words, optimizing the variable “solvent” will require optimizing as many additional dimensions as the number of potential solvents considered.In this talk we will present recent advances in the development of ML algorithms and parametrization techniques tailored to the optimization of multitarget categorical features. Highlighting the power of machine learning and chemical knowledge to accelerate reaction optimization using small data. Starting with as little as 5 data points, SuntheticsML algorithms are able to reach unprecedented efficiencies requiring up to 15x less time and experiments. We will also discuss a wide range of recent case studies featuring catalytical applications, including cross coupling, mechanochemistry and electrochemistry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSolid acid catalyst characterization involves understanding adsorption interactions within aluminosilicate pores, which helps guide subsequent catalyst design. Different techniques exist for zeolite characterization to detail functionality and adsorbate interaction with the Brønsted acid site. Despite these techniques, information on the adsorption thermodynamics of adsorbates strongly bound to a Brønsted acid site, particularly entropic contributions, are relatively limited. The challenge arises from the requirement of establishing equilibrium between an adsorbate and Brønsted acid site to measure thermodynamic information; strongly bound adsorbates which do not desorb cannot attain an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Relative thermodynamic information however can be obtained when exposing a Brønsted acid site to multiple strongly bound intermediates, which collectively behave as competitive adsorbates that attain an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Here we present a newly developed method that leverages this approach of relative thermodynamics, reactive calorimetry, where we measure the adsorption thermodynamics of alkylamines on Brønsted acid sites. The method is comprised of three main steps: in-situ pre-treatment, establishing co-adsorbate equilibrium (Surface Equilibration) and temperature programmed surface reaction of the adsorbed alkylamines (Reaction Analysis,Figure 1). The entire method is carried out within a gas chromatograph, serving both as an automated reactor and a quantification tool. By measuring the relative coverages of multiple alkylamines at varying partial pressure and temperatures, we are able to establish the adsorption energetics of alkylamines over MFI zeolites as a proof of concept. Reactive calorimetry as a technique therefore affords us the ability to expand our understanding of adsorption thermodynamics, particularly for adsorbates strongly bound to Brønsted acid sites in solid acid catalysts. Ultimately, the adsorption interactions of multiple alkylamines on various zeolite frameworks, provide the means to compare, select and optimize zeolite catalysts for different chemistries based on adsorbate energetics of transition-state-like molecules.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCurrently, the most effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) are comprised of noble metal oxides, which bring issues of high cost and scarcity. Discovering earth-abundant alternatives is challenging due to the costly and time-consuming experiments. High-throughput atomistic simulation of catalysts can be an efficient route for enabling the better design and discovery of new electrocatalysts. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the presence of an activity descriptor that can accurately capture both qualitative and quantitative catalytic trends. In the past, multiple descriptors based on electronic properties have been proposed for reaction-specific or system-specific applications. Therefore, we need a descriptor, which can capture the bonding strength accurately for any sort of reaction or system.In this study, we are examining the relationship between adsorption energy and integrated COHP (ICOHP) values of a series of polymorphs in all conceivable oxidation states, ranging from +2 to +6, respectively. We have observed a strong correlation between the integrated COHP (ICOHP) of the bulk system and the adsorption energy, which indicates expensive surface-level electronic calculations can be replaced by bulk-level computations. However, this correlation does not hold on two classes of systems: (i) d0systems and (ii) systems with significant surface distortion during the reaction. To address these systems, we have considered a different approach where we consider the sum of ICOHP values around the active site, and then expand the sum rule to include neighboring and next neighboring centers, rather than relying solely on a single bond ICOHP value.",

    "abstract": "AbstractComputational techniques such as first-principles calculations including density functional theory, and statistical learning are used as tools to screen through large numbers of potential catalysts to find viable candidates for numerous chemical reactions, as well as descriptors to measure the viability of a catalyst candidate. However, many machine learning tools operate as a black box and the identified results are difficult to interpret through a physical lens. We attempt to elucidate some of the mysteries of these black-box methods to find physically interpretable descriptors for reaction intermediate adsorption energies, using unary and binary metals as a model system, and compare these statistically generated descriptors to existing analytical models. Specifically, we use the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) method which takes in a matrix of material properties and combines them with each other using operators to form and identify physically interpretable descriptors.By manipulating feature choices considered in the training of the SISSO model, we show that the resulting descriptors and error trends can inform us about the types of material properties that contribute to catalytic activity. Figure 1 shows the scheme used to identify trends in descriptor types by using various types of feature sets. For instance, features can be split into categories of tabulated, geometric, and electronic features, and the error trends of models trained on these individual feature sets can pinpoint us in the right direction when looking for adsorption energy descriptors. We conclude that site-specific, electronic descriptors contribute heavily to the adsorption energy, regardless of which reaction intermediate is considered. This compares well to what is known from analytical models for these metal systems. To expand upon this work, other materials are considered, and stability effects are also targeted by expanding the dataset to include information about both activity and stability of different material classes.",

The workflow begins with a bulk optimization task that takes an initial bulk structure and returns the optimized bulk geometry and magnetic state, including stability under reaction conditions. The stable bulk structure is the input to a surface chemistry task that enumerates surfaces up to a user-specified maximum Miller index, computes relaxed surface energies for those surfaces, and then prioritizes those for subsequent adsorption energy calculations based on their contribution to the Wulff construction shape. While the workflow handles computational resource constraints such as limited wall-time as well as automated job submission and analysis, it still suffers from the computational complexity of DFT. In order to streamline the magnetic characterization part of WhereWulff, we have devised a scheme that can predict both the magnetic ordering and moment of atoms in a crystal. We first train a classifier to generate three types of embeddings, partitioning our dataset into three spin types. A regressor is then applied to the spin types that show appreciable magnetic behavior, circumventing the difficulties faced when standard deep learning solutions are deployed on a skewed continuous outcome with many zeros. Results are promising with 93 % F1 score for the spin type classification and ~0.2 Bohr-magneton MAE on the regressor.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCost-competitive production of sustainable fuels and chemicals requires the discovery of higher-performance catalysts, among other challenges. One proposed strategy for enhancing catalyst activity is programmable catalysis, in which temporal modulation of catalysts is predicted to promote reaction rates above that of a so-called static catalyst. Several microkinetic analyses by our group and others, including both thermocatalytic[1,2]and electrocatalytic[3]reactions, have predicted varying degrees of rate enhancement; the exact performance depends on the specific system under investigation. However, it is unclear how uncertainty in the model parameters propagates into the predicted performance of these programmable catalysts. In this work, we investigate how uncertainty in thermodynamic and kinetic scaling relations impacts the predicted rate enhancement of electrocatalytic series reactions. We quantify this uncertainty impact using a distributed evaluation of local sensitivity analysis (DELSA),[4]where the parameter space is determined from a review of electrocatalytic activation energies reported in the literature and sampled quasi-randomly. We compare our results to those of static (thermo)catalysts, for which uncertainties in rate predictions can span several orders of magnitude,[5]and identify cases where programmable electrocatalysts significantly enhance rates. Finally, we note that incorporation of parameter uncertainty in microkinetic models of electrocatalysis is especially important because the activation barriers of such reactions are not as well understood as thermochemistry due to the additional complexities of modeling electrochemical systems.[1]ACS Catal.2019, 9, 6929.[2]Sci.

Plasmonic metals such as Au and Ag have attracted significant attention due to their ability to harness light in the visible spectrum and have been used in a wide variety of applications, including driving catalytic reactions. Gaining insight into the mechanisms occurring in these plasmonic reactions is challenging but important for the rational design of new catalysts. Here, we utilize real-time, time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) to excite systems with oscillating electric fields and track the subsequent excited state dynamics in real time. Our work has shown the importance of the near-field enhancement for facilitating the dissociation of small molecules like O2and N2and the role that charge transfer can play in each case. In this presentation we focus on electron-level design and insights into practical applications of plasmonic photocatalysis such as deoxygenation of biomass-derived molecules using Au and Ag nanoparticles, as well as N2activation using so-called “antenna reactors”. We show how these plasmonic systems can be tuned to drive selective chemistry through the targeted activation of C-O bonds by adjusting nanoparticle composition, size and shape as well as the applied electric field frequency and amplitude. Further, we screen Cu-based antenna reactors to discover effective compositions for N2activation and gain detailed insights.

    "abstract": "AbstractIn the realm of heterogeneous catalysis, the stability, and shapes of active metal catalyst sites during reactions are critical for catalytic activity. This study aims to enhance our understanding of catalytic systems by building on previous coordination-based approaches [1] that predicted general configurational energies of metal nanostructures. However, the generalized scheme does not explicitly define partial coordination to neighboring atoms, making it challenging to understand the stability of adatoms during non-equilibrium states of diffusion or migration. Therefore, we use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate activation energies for atomic diffusions/migrations over various FCC surfaces to evaluate the stability of metal atoms. From these results, we extract coordination-based parameters to fit to the energies of atoms at non-equilibrium distances. This extended model is used to gain a better understanding of surface restructuring and sintering in heterogeneous catalytic contexts, such as copper catalysts during electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction.Moreover, the optimization of catalytic activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis relies on various surface properties, particularly surface energies, and the distribution of site morphologies. Therefore, we also evaluate surface energies and predict the relative stabilities of various catalytic surfaces using the mentioned coordination schemes. We use periodic slabs and various metal nanoparticle (MNP) shapes to determine surface energies and extended this approach to multimetallic surfaces (alloys) to describe segregation behaviors in multimetallic alloys (MMAs) to predict the relative surface concentrations of the various constituent metals.Overall, this physics-based approach allows for the effective screening of thermodynamic stabilities of alloy MNPs by integrating coordination schemes with structural and site information. The resulting models can be applied to calculate the energetics of any nanoparticle morphology and chemical composition, thus significantly accelerating the design of durable nanoalloys, potentially extending to high entropy alloys.1.Roling, L.T., The Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 2017. 121(41): p. 23002-23010.",

This is currently achieved by employing sensitivity analysis over a comprehensive reaction network (CRN) to screen reaction species. However, as a reaction network is being simplified for a particular catalyst composition, it loses its transferability to other compositions. Therefore, in this study, a two-way approach is presented to circumvent this problem. Firstly, a generalisable model outcome is identified, i.e. minimum reactant conversions (xR), based on a mass-flow analysis. Then, a stepwise workflow is developed for constructing a partial reaction network (PRN) to insure transferability of min(xR) for a range of varying catalyst energetics, in the absence of experimental data for validation. Lastly, the transferability of this approach is demonstrated for CH4dry reforming by developing a PRN using Ni(111) as the initial catalyst and testing it over Ru(001).",

These reactors are used in high-pressure operations such as hydroprocessing of crude oil (i.e., hydrotreating and hydrocracking). However, many issues related to the use of these reactors for crude oil hydroprocessing have been found, such as the maldistribution of the liquid and gas phases due to coke formation and catalyst agglomeration. The lower plenum of the reactor has been identified as the cause of the non-uniformity in the distribution of the flowing gas and liquid phases in the reactor. Due to the design of the lower plenum, with one deflector in the center, maldistribution of the flowing liquid and gas phases at this lower plenum, is the main reason behind the non-uniformity of the distribution of the phases in the reactor’s core. In order to maximize the efficiency of these reactors, it is essential to develop a plenum design that would allow the uniform mixing and distribution of the flowing phases through the bed. However, the studies and publications that deal with the effect of the design of these reactors on their complex hydrodynamics are limited. Therefore, this research project investigates the hydrodynamics of a (U-PBR), with modified plenum designs in order to develop a design that improves the efficiency of these reactors by enhancing the mixing and distribution of the gas and liquid phases. To this end, the liquid and gas holdups in the plenum were measured to assess the distribution and mixing of the flowing phases with the original design and the modified designs using a sophisticated non-invasive technique called Gamma-Ray Densitometry (GRD).

In the inertial region at highRea careful analysis of the widely disagreeing literature data shows that many studies present inconsistent values for void fraction, which has a strong effect on pressure drop. The accepted data shows reasonable agreement with the Dixon correlation above, with only small decreases for very low values of tube-to-particle diameter ratio (N) in the inertial range.

    "abstract": "AbstractPeriodic operation of catalytic reactors has been shown to be a viable method of improving reactant conversions and product selectivities. However, mathematical complexity of transient design equations complicates the ability to identify regions of process enhancement through dynamic relative to conventional steady state (SS) operation. In this study, we describe methods to determine limits of process enhancement during low frequency quasi-steady state (QSS) operation of chemical reactors. During QSS operation, the net concavity of rate expressions directly correlates to differences between local QSS and SS rates. In general, QSS rates are enlarged by convex and reduced by concave relationships. Rate expression convexity stems from apparent reaction orders outside the range 0 to 1 whereas concavity arises from orders within this range. These effects can be applied to determine limits of dynamic enhancement for complex Langmuir Hinshelwood rate expressions. For instance, fig. 1a shows that conversion versus the Damkohler number (Da) in the QSS reactor surpasses that achieved by the SS reactor for a binary reaction involving competitive adsorption over a catalyst surface. Fig. 1a also shows that the local QSS rate enhancement (Δ) as a function of Da reaches a maximum at Da=0.22 before rapidly dropping below zero. The sudden decrease in Δ is a result of changing convexity as the dominant inhibiting reactant B is consumed at higher Da, resulting in a shift from a negative to positive apparent reaction order at its concentration wave minima. Fig. 1b shows that the apparent reaction order of the SS solution at the concentration wave minima for species B changes from negative to positive at the Da of maximum enhancement. Here, we have demonstrated that analysis through SS material balances can offer great insight into determining enhancement limitations during low frequency dynamic operation of chemical reactors.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNaphtha cracking process is essential to produce elementary chemicals such as ethylene and propylene. The yield of naphtha cracking process is hard to be estimated and optimized due to its complex relations of various operating conditions. Although many theoretical and mathematical methods have been tried to solve the above problem, it needs lots of equations for reactions and time for calculation. Recently, there has been considerable interest in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning methods. This paper aims to investigate the application of quantum neural networks (QNNs) to predict product yields of naphtha cracking furnace, and discuss the impacts of the number of features and layers on the yield prediction performance. Their designs, implementation and results are stated as following steps. First, coil outlet temperature (COT) and compositions of major components in naphtha including normal paraffins and aromatics were selected as the features due to their considerable impacts on the product yield. Second, three QNN models was developed depending on the number of layers (three, four, and five). Lastly, the models were evaluated with the coefficient of determinant (R2) and compared with each other to select the optimal QNN-based model. Additionally, this paper describes some challenges of state-of-the-art quantum computers and their great potential to impact the field of chemical engineering.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrooxidation of ammonia (AOR) to dinitrogen plays a crucial role within the nitrogen cycle, and has important applications in wastewater remediation and direct ammonia fuel cells. While platinum (Pt) based catalysts, specifically terminated with (100) facets, have shown promising activity, they suffer from a large overpotential and surface deactivation. These issues have been tackled via the use of bimetallic and trimetallic Pt-based alloys, however the lack of a clear mechanistic understanding of ammonia electrooxidation has hindered significant improvements. Moreover, traditional trial-and-error approaches struggle searching through the high-dimensional design space of trimetallic systems. Although modern machine learning (ML) approaches have shown great potential in screening such immense design spaces, their black-box nature makes it impossible to understand model predictions and draw physical insights.We first present a brief analysis of the thermodynamics and kinetics for the NH3oxidation to N2on various transition metals from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is shown that due to the balanced *N bridge and hollow binding energies only Pt and Ir are able to oxidize NH3to N2. Subsequently, linear energy-scaling relationships were integrated with a microkinetic model to develop an activity volcano map that can explain activity trends on metals and state-of-the-art Pt-based alloys. To screen for active and stable trimetallic electrocatalysts, we use the activity map and TinNet within an active learning scheme with different filters, e.g., reactivity, synthesizability, and stability metrics. From a vast design space consisting of Pt-based trimetallic alloys we find promising stable and active candidates, e.g., Pt3Ru doped with Co. This approach is verified via controlled synthesis and electrochemical testing of the catalyst. Lastly, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is used to gain fundamental understanding of physical factors that govern the site reactivity and to identify key design rules to further aid catalyst discovery.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith growing environmental awareness and a combined effort towards reducing our carbon footprint, greener alternatives to energy-fuels are being implemented. Hydrogen is vital, futuristic energy as its burning is COx-free. Hydrogen is generated through multiple established routes, of which hydrocarbon steam reforming is the most widespread. Steam reforming is a mature technology with readily available resources, and moderate-high operating conditions. However, the use of hydrocarbons inevitably brings the production of COx. It, therefore, needs to be avoided in the long-term carbon neutrality goal. Cleaner, greener routes for H2production have been proposed to overcome the issues posed by steam reforming, one of them is ammonia cracking. Ammonia is a carbon-free hydrogen vector that is easier to store, transport, and convert to hydrogen via catalytic ammonia decomposition. Compared to methane steam reforming, ammonia decomposition is less endothermic (220vs. 46 kJ mol–1) and needs milder conditions (800vs. 500 °C). Therefore, a steam reformer can be repurposed as ammonia cracker with minimal modifications.Towards that effect, we present a combined process simulations and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to repurpose an industrial steam reformer as an ammonia cracker. The proposed reformer is modeled in a shell-and-tube configuration, with a Ba-Co-Ce catalyst loaded in multiple tubes and heated from the shell. Firstly, laboratory-scale ammonia decomposition runs were performed in a packed-bed reactor from which intrinsic kinetics were obtained as a modified power-law rate expression. Coupling them with a 2D cylindrical catalyst pellet incorporating heat-mass transfer effects in a cracker tube, process optimization is performed using gPROMS®. The optimization studies suggest using a profiled wall temperature to effectively use the entire tube length; avoiding cold spots (Figure 1). In the following stages, LES-based CFD simulations are performed using Barracuda Virtual Reactor® to further propose effective temperature control strategies for this endothermic reaction.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRecent experimental capabilities enable the introduction of precisely controlled perturbations in heterogeneous catalytic reactors e.g. in terms of electrodynamic potential [1] or dynamic strain [2]. Systematic application of such perturbations can be viewed as externally enforced “programs” of catalytic activity [3]. It is long known that such programs, when appropriately tuned, have the potential to improve catalytic performance orders of magnitude over the static (or unperturbed) optimum; this has already been demonstrated computationally and experimentally [1]. In this work we computationally discover optimal programs for ammonia synthesis on a ruthenium crystal under oscillating dynamic strain [2]. We use a detailed, high-dimensional, kinetic model which takes into account different types of catalytic sites (such as terrace, upper step, lower step). Using advanced tools from scientific computing (matrix-free time-stepper-based solvers) and active learning (Bayesian Optimization) we demonstrate efficient discovery of optimal dynamic strain programs for ammonia synthesis. Our algorithmic pipeline is specifically designed to deal with detailed kinetic models (high-dimensional state space) and programs of complex shape (high-dimensional parameter space). Furthermore, algorithms such as Bayesian Optimization can be extended to the laboratory and motivate efficient, data-driven real-world applications of dynamic catalysis.References[1] M.A. Ardagh, M.

    "abstract": "AbstractManganese modified Fe2O3catalyst is an effective way to replace the traditional commercial NH3-SCR catalyst to achieve low temperature and high selectivity removal of NOxto N2from gas emission of fixed sources. In order to clarify the influence mechanism of different interaction modes between Mn and Fe on the NOxconversion and N2selectivity of catalysts at low temperature, Mn doped Fe2O3and MnO2loaded Fe2O3are prepared by co-precipitation method and impregnation method respectively. It is demonstrated that the doped Mn cations can provide more Lewis acid sites and more abundant Mn4+species, which lead to the improvement of NOxconversion at low temperature. Meanwhile, doped Mn cations activate the oxidation ability of surrounding Fe atoms through the strong electron transfer between Mn and Fe, making Fe become the main reaction site of NH3oxidation into NH2species, and inhibit its excessive oxidation to NH species. This mechanism provides theoretical support for exploring the interaction between binary metal oxides and improving the activity and N2selectivity of NH3-SCR catalysts at low temperature.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSince liquid ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier, interest is growing in novel heterogeneous catalysts for ammonia synthesis under reaction conditions milder than the Haber-Bosch process, which uses an iron catalyst. Supported ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles have emerged as an alternative catalyst but suffer from hydrogen poisoning, preventing higher ammonia synthesis rates at higher pressures. Supports that can facilitate hydrogen spillover and strong metal support interactions (SMSI) can alleviate hydrogen poisoning. However, state-of-the-art supports such as nitrides, hydrides, and electrides prevent them from large-scale use due to air and moisture sensitivity and complex synthesis processes. Mixed metal oxide supports containing lanthanides such as BaCeO3, La2Ce2O7,and La2Pr2O7are promising due to their higher activity, stability, and ease of synthesis. Large amounts of lanthanide-containing mixed metal oxide supports remain unexplored in the literature.In this work, we use machine learning (ML) combined with experimental validation to investigate novel oxide supports for Ru nanoparticles. The ML model is developed with catalyst activity data for unpromoted Ru on metal oxide supports mined from literature. Descriptors are engineered and selected for the model which represents catalytic properties of the support (basicity, reducibility, etc.) and support surface processes (SMSI, hydrogen spillover, etc.). Model interpretations led to insights about support properties that lead to higher ammonia synthesis activity. The model is then used to predict the activity of catalysts with all lanthanide metal-containing oxide supports extracted from the materials project database and filtered based on thermodynamic stability and synthesizability. The predicted oxide supports with higher activities are experimentally synthesized and tested for model validation which led to the discovery of novel oxide supports for ammonia synthesis. Selected novel supports are characterized for basicity and reducibility to verify the model interpretations.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPolymer based multi-layer films are commonly used to provide the combined performance of multiple plastics to their application. Typically used in the food, biomedical and packaging industries, these films are not commonly recycled due to contamination and difficulties in separating the layers of these films. Typically adhered via coextrusion or lamination, these films cannot be easily separated, and our current recycling processes cannot handle mixed waste products. Current research uses a targeted solvent process to dissolve one part of these systems, capture the material in a filter and subject it to an anti-solvent to recover the polymer. While potentially effective, these methods utilize many toxic solvents, generating unnecessary waste. This work proposes an alternative of using supercritical water and green solvent mixtures. Water is non-toxic and abundant, unlike the organic solvents proposed in previous work. Moreover, the solvation properties of water can be tuned by adjusting the temperature or by addition of environmentally benign cosolvents. The challenge is selecting conditions for polymer solubility that do not result in polymer degradation.In this work, the Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) of hydrothermal, near critical and supercritical water were calculated as a function of temperature and pressure using different published methods of calculation. HSPs can then be used to select conditions for solubilization of different polymers, with the objective being selective fractionation of multilayer polymer films. A second set of calculations was then performed for mixtures of water with acetone, ethanol, methanol, 2-methyltetrehydrofuran (MeTHF), and ethyl acetate as representative green solvents. These solvents were chosen because they can solubilize some of the selected polymers at room temperature and have low environmental impact. These calculations were performed to find the relative energy distance (RED), solubility conditions and guide experimental work.The relative energy distance or RED for selected solvent blends and supercritical water can be seen below in Figure 1. A lower RED is indicative the polymer will solubilize in the selected solvent. Typically, the RED at room temperature should be below one however, at elevated temperatures solubility can increase due to increased entropy. From Figure 1, supercritical water at 450 °C and beyond shows a similar RED to the 15% solvent blends. The solvent blend with the lowest RED value is 85% acetone in water. These preliminary results show that the solvation properties of supercritical water can be tuned with temperature which can solubilize polymers with sufficiently low RED values.Based off the results of Figure 1, 85% acetone in water can be assumed to be the best solvent. Figure 2 shows the solubility sphere of 85% acetone and the nine selected polymers. Figure 2 indicates that polymers inside the sphere are considered soluble with the solvent, polymers on the edge will likely experience swelling, and polymers outside the sphere are not soluble with the solvent. From Figure 2, many common polymers will interact with the water-acetone mixture sufficiently to swell, if not completely solubilize. Solvent-plastic interaction will allow for selective fractionation of films depending on solvent properties. While the acetone-water mixture still requires an organic solvent, it has the potential for tuned polymer miscibility and fractionation. Open questions include the reactivity of polymers at these conditions. Tests are ongoing to evaluate reactivity and solubility in water-acetone mixtures near the critical point.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA fundamental understanding of the chemical interactions between copper (Cu) and carbon dioxide molecules is pivotal to gain detailed insights on the initial steps of carbon dioxide conversion on Cu surfaces. Herein, ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) using synchrotron radiation-based tender X-rays (4 keV) was employed to study the chemical dynamics of Cu surfaces with increasing the pressure of carbon dioxide. The surface Cu of polycrystalline metal foil was oxidized to Cu(II) upon exposure to carbon dioxide, particularly beyond 10 Torr, and then reduced back when removing the carbon dioxide gas to restore high vacuum condition. A linear correlation was built up between carbon dioxide pressure and surface Cu(II) proportion. The growth and recession of the Cu(II) overlayer is attributed to the interaction of adsorbed oxygen species from the direct dissociation of adsorbed carbon dioxide with the surface metallic Cu sites and their fast transport through the Cu(II) overlayer. The observed reversible phenomenon of the Cu(II) layer evolution induced by dissociative carbon dioxide adsorption on Cu surface has been verified on other two reported carbon dioxide-reduction systems: p-GaN/Au/Cu and p-Si/TaOx/Cu. We unveil a universal and reversible oxidation of Cu towards Cu(II) at the initial step of carbon dioxide conversion, providing atomistic insights for the design and construction of highly efficient and selective Cu-based catalysts.Key words: reversible Cu oxidation; chemical interaction with CO2; ambient-pressure XPS",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn the iron and steel-making process, the direct reduced iron (DRI) is the very first step that uses CO and H2to reduce iron ore and therefore contributes to fewer CO2emissions than the conventional blast furnace process. The CO and H2required for the DRI process are generated through the steam and natural gas reforming in reformer tubes filled with catalyst particles. The bottom-fired burners in the reformer undergo combustion and provide energy to the tubes by radiation and promote the endothermic reforming reactions to produce reducing gas (i.e., CO and H2). These gases are transported to the shaft furnace for iron-ore reduction. Therefore, the DRI reforming process plays an essential role for DRI production in the shaft furnace by supplying reducing gases of desired compositions, flow rate and temperature. An understanding of the influence of (i) process operating conditions of burner and tube side and (ii) catalyst loading profile on the reduced gas quality and temperature is important to further improve the efficiency of the reforming process.In the present work an integrated 3D-CFD model of the DRI reforming process: (i) burner and tube coupled model that includes multicomponent gas flow in burner and tubes, (ii) heat and mass transfer due to combustion and radiation on the burner side, and (iii) endothermic reforming reactions on the tube side is developed. Figure 1 (a) shows the reformer geometry considered in the present work. It consists of 6 reformer tubes and 3 main burners present at the bottom between the tubes (see Figure 1 (a)). On the burner side, fuel gas and combustion air are given as input and undergo combustion resulting in higher temperature and consumption of O2(see Figure 2 (a) and 2 (b)). In the tube, the presence of the catalyst particles influences the flow field and the pressure drop. A variable radial porosity profile is generated from rigid body simulations and mapped into the tube domain. The pressure drop on the tube-side due to the presence of catalyst is calculated through porous media approach. In the tube-side, due to steam-methane reforming the mole fractions of CH4and H2O decreased and, CO and H2increased from bottom to the top of tube (see Figure 2 (c)-(f)). Further, the model predictions of the outlet mole fraction and temperature are validated with the plant data for different burner and tube inlet operating conditions. The developed CFD model can be used to further investigate the effects of the (i) process (tube and burner inlet operating conditions) and (ii) design conditions (tube dimensions, catalyst loading profiles) on the tube wall temperature and reduced gas quality.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWidely used as an essential building block for making resins and plastics, ethylene is a key platform chemical with a relatively large carbon footprint and production concentrated in the United States, Middle East, and China. Today, ethylene is manufactured through steam-cracking of ethane and naphtha, which has CO2emissions of 1~1.6 tonne (t) per t of ethylene. As material demand for ethylene is anticipated to increase with economic growth in various regions, there is an urgency to develop and deploy sustainable production routes and avoid “emissions lock-in” from the deployment of existing production routes. Possible options under consideration include: a ) direct electrification to substitute fossil fuel for heating during steam cracking, b) use of low-carbon hydrogen to provide heat for the cracking process, where the hydrogen is produced via alternative approaches including byproduct methane reforming with carbon capture and storage (CCS), c) dehydration of ethanol produced from sustainably available biomass resources as well as d) less mature, but potentially transformative approaches based on electrochemical conversion of ethane or methane. These technological options span alternative feedstocks, novel interactions with the other energy infrastructure, like the electricity grid and hydrogen infrastructure, and have different scaling properties, which must be considered when performing a comparative analysis.The objective of this work is to perform a systematic techno-economic and environmental analysis of alternative low-carbon ethylene production routes that consider the above-mentioned factors. Our approach is based on: a) developing detailed process simulations for each process to allow for characterizing mass and energy balances and unit sizing, b) techno-economic analysis (TEA) to compare the cost and economic risks of each process according to various types of energy system interactions and c) life cycle analysis (LCA) to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact spanning cradle-to-gate system boundary, that considers co-product disposition and energy infrastructure interactions. The results will provide insights for research and development teams and industry stakeholders by identifying key process drivers that will help reduce costs, emissions, and investment risks for each process.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe chemical industry is investing in renewable resources and exploring various initiatives to achieve energy transition and decarbonization goals, such as using green hydrogen, carbon capture and storage technologies, electrification of heat, and electrochemical conversion. However, uncertainties around new technologies, electricity and carbon prices, and capital investment make navigating the transition complex. The industry must change to meet decarbonization standards, but valuable infrastructure should not be prematurely discarded for emerging technologies. There is a dilemma of when to transition and which initiative to adopt, as switching too early leads to inefficiencies and switching too late increases the carbon footprint.In this work we address the problem of determining the optimal retrofit electrification of an existing oil refinery. We propose a generic process refinery flowsheet that represents the current operations of an oil refinery. We then consider several electrification alternatives that have been identified from the literature. These electrification alternatives together with the refinery flowsheet are included in the superstructure that is to be optimized. Examples of the alternative electrification technologies include e-boilers, alternative pathways for hydrogen generation, connection to decarbonized electricity grids and battery storage. The different electrification alternatives are combined with the initial flowsheet to create a network superstructure of alternative flowsheets in which existing units of the refinery can be removed, replaced by new units, or reassigned to perform a different task, which in turn may require new interconnections of. the units. Data on the technological readiness level, capital and operating costs, and uncertainties associated with each alternative have been obtained from various sources.The optimization of the superstructure to find the minimum cost electrified refinery is formulated as a Mixed-integer Linear programming model that includes simplified process equations, as well as logical and feasibility constraints for removal and addition of units and interconnections. The proposed objective function includes capital and operating expenses of the potential technologies to be selected, as well as taxes for CO2emissions to promote sustainability goals. This MILP model is also extended to a multi-period optimization problem in order to consider long-term planning horizons, e.g. a ten-year long plan for a given forecast of product demands, and that can determine the optimal timeline for switching to the decarbonized options. Numerical results of the proposed MILP models are presented for nominal values of the parameters, as well as for several scenarios that include changes in the costs and performance of electrification technologies, the price of crude oil, and the carbon tax. The results show the potential economic advantages associated the optimal electrification for the retrofit of oil refineries. Finally, we briefly discuss how the proposed MILP models could be extended with stochastic programming techniques to explicitly account for uncertainties in the parameters of the MILP models.",

Among the various CO2removal technologies, indirect ocean capture (IOC) is an emerging approach for direct removal of atmospheric CO2via extraction of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from seawater, followed by air-seawater re-equilibration. Unlike CO2capture from large stationary emission sources, IOC has the potential to manage both the existing excess CO2in the atmosphere, as well as CO2from mobile or smaller point sources. Moreover, given that the CO2concentration (mg/L) in seawater is approximately 140 times greater than that in air, IOC can avoid processing the large volumes of air (e.g., via pumping and compressing) that is required for Direct Air Capture (DAC) techniques. Motivated by the growing body of literature on IOC in the last 5 years, in this study, we present a critical review and provide a quantitative perspective on IOC technologies which then provides support for the proposed process scheme for integration of IOC with a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant to extract CO2from RO brine. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) was then carried out to evaluate the mutual benefits to both the IOC facility and the desalination plant via.Here we note that control of solution pH and CO2partial pressure has been employed in various proposed IOC technologies, including for example, membrane separation, ion-exchange resin, and electrochemical techniques. However, most of the studies are still at the bench-scale proof-of-concept stages and face various challenges that include: (i) insoluble scales form and deposit at the cathode and membrane surfaces, leading to increased cell resistance and compromised electrolytic efficiency, (ii) slow CO2extraction rate and thus low extraction efficiency, (iii) high electrochemical energy consumption, and (iv) high capital and operating costs due to membrane contactor vacuum stripping and seawater pretreatment. At the current state-of-the-art, bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPCEM) has been touted as one of the most practical IOC methods (with up to 98% lower electrochemical energy consumption). The above technology was thus considered in analyzing the potential adoption of IOC via TEA and LCA.TEA analysis suggests that a stand-alone IOC facility is not yet feasible. However, the overall IOC cost via co-location with other ocean water-pumping technologies, especially seawater desalination plants, can be reduced up to 59% compared to a stand-alone facility. The IOC cost can be further reduced by utilizing SWRO desalination brine, which will double the CO2concentration in the seawater; hence, a reduction in the volume of seawater that requires processing via IOC. More importantly, as CO2solubility decreases with increasing solution salinity, a much higher CO2extraction rate can be achieved by spontaneous degassing of the acidified RO desalination brine (73%) relative to acidified seawater (40%). Consequently, the proposed IOC process, co-located with a seawater desalination plant using RO brine for CO2extraction, can reduce the cost of IOC to $138/tCO2, which is ca. 96% lower than a stand-alone IOC system. It is also stressed that IOC co-location is beneficial to the seawater desalination plant since it will lead to (i) generation of extra revenue through RO brine valorization, and (ii) lowering the total volume and salinity of the brine that needs to be discharged for disposal, ultimately mitigating the negative environmental impact of the desalination process. In addition, the carbon credit earned through CO2capture can provide extra revenue for the desalination industry, leading to a reduction of freshwater production cost by ~6% (using a projected carbon price of $150/tCO2in 2050). Finally, integrating IOC can help the desalination industry achieve negative carbon emissions. In conclusion, the IOC co-location with seawater desalination plants will have the benefits of economic CO2removal, combating global climate change together with other CO2removal technologies, and improving the sustainability and cost efficiency of seawater desalination. Implementing the above proposed approach will require research efforts that focus on the development and optimization of the IOC technologies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrification of the fertilizer production industry can enable serious decarbonization efforts globally, especially those based on renewable electricity. Currently, ammonia is manufactured based on the heavily centralized Haber-Bosch process, which accounts for 2% of global energy consumption and 1.2% of carbon emissions. Moreover, phosphorous mines create heavy metal hazardous waste streams and are ultimately non-renewable. As an alternative, recovery of fertilizer nutrients from wastewater streams, either in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) or concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), has been proposed to achieve more decentralized and sustainable fertilizer production. These wastewater streams contain large amounts of ammonia (N) and phosphorus (P) that can be recycled for direct use on farms. Currently, these components are not recovered in the vast majority of WWTPs and CAFOs. Usually the N/P components are either neutralized or directly released into the environment. The challenges with recovering these products is that the starting streams are very dilute, highly variable, and geographically distributed. Therefore, a viable recovery process must be flexible, modular, and able to exploit distributed renewable energy sources.Currently, there are many methods for nutrient recovery including crystallization, air stripping, and biological treatment. However, these methods require additional chemicals, operate at high pH, require careful biological controls, and are not well-suited to modular implementations using renewable electricity. In contrast, electrochemical separations may provide a very promising route for distributed nutrient recovery . Over the last few decades, electrochemical separations have been used extensively for desalination purposes to meet drinking water needs where resources are constrained. Specifically, electrodialytic (ED) ion-exchange membrane-based processes allow for lower energy consumption and direct energy usage in the form of renewable electricity versus thermal or pressure driven systems. Electrodialysis systems also have fast dynamics which can easily deal with fluctuations in power caused by using renewable energy intermittency. Given the vast number of commercial installations for desalination, there is scant literature published on electrochemical separations for nutrient recovery of fertilizer from WWTP or CAFO streams.This talk will present a novel modeling framework and process simulation tool for ED-based nutrient recovery processes. The tool can predict pilot and commercial scale performance to quickly iterate system designs based on number of stages required, membrane area, as well as energy requirements. This simulation tool also considers the key dynamics caused by renewable energy and feedstock variability, and is therefore well suited for studying process control strategies. This is a significant contribution because, at present, commercial chemical process simulators do not support electrochemical unit operations such as ED, and there is no easily accessible or standardized simulation code for such processes in the literature. Using this tool, we can pave a way for future process control strategies and design modular processes that can be dispatched where needed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRenewable ammonia production using hydrogen sourced from electrolysis is an emerging approach to alleviating the 2% of global emissions attributed to synthetic nitrogen fertilizer production. A distributed implementation of renewable production facilities close to the agricultural end user has additional potential to mitigate the costs and emissions associated with interstate or even international transport of ammonia currently produced at large-scale centralized facilities. Local ownership of new renewable ammonia production could insulate the end user (e.g., the farmers) against fluctuations in fertilizer prices that have historically occurred on the global ammonia market. In the United States, recent federal policy such as investment and/or production tax credits for power generation and hydrogen production with low associated carbon intensity [1] has improved the economic viability of this approach to decarbonizing agriculture.Despite the potential benefits, replacing ammonia fertilizer produced using fossil fuels and transported over a national or even global scale with such locally produced renewable ammonia will not be instantaneous. To this end, we develop a multi-scale optimal supply chain transition model which maximizes the economic benefit of developing a local renewable ammonia supply chain. We first optimize renewable ammonia production facility to minimize the levelized cost of ammonia over a range of (i) installation years from present-day to 2030 which affects cost curves of constituent technologies such as electrolysis, (ii) production scales, and locations with differing wind and solar renewable generation potential. Renewable variability is accounted for through a combination of intermediate storage (e.g., batteries, hydrogen buffer) and oversized chemical production pursuing variable production rates. These design features are optimized through simultaneous technology selection, sizing, and hourly scheduling with hourly resolution representative years for wind and PV capacity factors in each location used as input data, as is the prevailing approach in the literature [2-4]. The results of this production facility optimization are subsequently used as input data to a supply chain transition optimization model. This model has annual resolution and determines the installation year, production scale, and location of new renewable ammonia production facilities as well as how this new means of ammonia production will augment and eventually replace importing ammonia from the existing producers in meeting spatially resolved (e.g., county-by-county) demands [5] in a manner which minimizes the 30 year net present cost of the supply chain.We present a case study for Minnesota’s ammonia fertilizer supply chain transition demonstrating the economic viability of such a transition by 2032 over a range of historically observed market ammonia prices. This analysis includes constraints on the scale of renewable generation facilities informed by existing installations in Minnesota as well as electrolysis availability informed by global projections of annual manufacturing. The analysis also incorporates the possibility of claiming investment or production tax credits for renewable power generation and clean hydrogen production to understand how such policy incentivizes the adoption of decarbonized fertilizer production and to quantify the economic opportunity created by such policy from the perspective of the state of Minnesota. Ultimately, we hypothesis that such an economically optimal renewable ammonia supply chain transition will enable significant reduction in the carbon intensity of fertilizer supply along with considerable opportunities for local economic development.References[1] Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, H.R.5376 (2022).https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text[2] Fasihi et al.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe global mean surface temperature reached 1℃ above pre-industrial times in 2017 and is projected to reach 1.5℃ as early as 2030 [1]. Significant efforts need to be made to decrease greenhouse emissions to limit the impacts such as biodiversity loss and increased severity/frequency of severe weather events [2,3]. Large industrial sectors such as urban centers, chemical companies, manufacturing facilities, and microgrid systems are actively looking for technology pathways that can help minimize their carbon footprint. An important and representative set of industrial systems that is actively seeking to decarbonize operations are university campuses. Campuses involve large collections of buildings that consume heating, cooling, power, and transportation services. To give some perspective into the magnitude of these systems, we note that over 16.5 million students in the US reside on university campuses [4]. It is estimated US campuses emit 7.7 MTCO2e per student and are responsible for 2% of the 5,222 million MTCO2e of the US greenhouse gas emissions [5,6].The number of new technologies that can be used to decrease greenhouse gas emissions is steadily increasing and complicates decision-making processes. In the context of university campuses, for instance, detailed mixed-integer optimization models have been developed to determine suitable system configurations [7-10]. Existing optimization models are typically intended to provide long-term investment plans to achieve decarbonization and are often hindered by the fact that there might not be sufficient data to evaluate emerging technologies.In this work, we present a graph-based optimization framework for analyzing technology pathways that can provide desired product demand targets while minimizing supply and technology costs by seeking to maximize the total surplus. Our modeling approach aims to provide a unifying framework that captures diverse technologies and their interconnectivity via products. Moreover, the framework aims to use a minimum amount of data for technologies (e.g., efficiencies, capacities, operating costs, investment costs), thus providing a “high-level” picture on the technology landscape and on potential factors that influence the economic viability of diverse technologies. Moreover, this approach aims to enable fast screening of pathways and to conduct parametric studies under diverse market and policy scenarios.We show that the proposed graph-based model can be interpreted as a value chain in which there is no transportation and spatial context; specifically, the model is a simplification of a multi-product supply chain model [11,12]. This observation is important, as the model proposed can provide valuable preliminary insights that can inform the development of more sophisticated infrastructure models (e.g., that capture transportation and spatial effects). Duality analysis of the proposed model reveals that this has a natural market (value chain) interpretation that can help identify technology pathways that maximize profit for stakeholders and that helps reveal the inherent value (prices) of intermediate products. This price information is key in market studies that involve sector coupling (e.g., hydrogen, ammonia, and power). Moreover, the graph-based abstraction reveals how externalities (e.g., carbon taxes or product demands) propagate through the value chain and affect prices of diverse products.Our developments are illustrated via a case study involving a prototypical university campus that seeks to identify pathways to reduce its carbon footprint (e.g., via electrification and deployment of hydrogen technologies). Analysis conducted with our framework reveals carbon tax values, technology targets, and investment budgets that can help achieve different levels of decarbonization.[1]V.

    "abstract": "AbstractIncreasing automotive emissions regulations are driving the need for improved catalysts to mitigate production of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). While NOxcan be decomposed by adding excess reactants, the ability to mitigate NOxcatalytically without the addition of reactants can lead to higher efficiency combustion engines. Direct decomposition of NO to N2and O2is an ideal reductant-free solution; previous studies have investigated Cu-substituted, Co-based spinel catalysts (CuxCo3-xO4) for this application.Ex-situstudies have found a bulk structure-activity relationship in the CuxCo3-xO4catalysts, showing that NO decomposition activity increases with Cu2+incorporation into the spinel tetrahedral sites.OperandoCu K-edge XAS analysis has observed the generation of a linearly bound Cu1+species during pretreatment that was not identified in theex-situmeasurements. To further improve the CuxCo3-xO4system, machine learning has been used to identify that adding Mn to the system would enhance NO conversion. To investigate the impact of the Mn dopant on the resultant structure and the change in the reaction product distribution of nitrogen containing compounds,operandoK-edge XAS of Mn and Cu in Mn0.1CuxCo2.9-xO4catalysts were performed under NO decomposition reaction conditions with simultaneous product detection via mass spectrometry (MS). It was found that while the Mn K-edge shows subtle changes in coordination geometry during the pretreatment and NO reaction, the Cu K-edge shows evolution of Cu1+species in linear geometry, as seen in the Mn-free system. However, the inclusion of Mn seems to enhance the stability of linear Cu1+species under steady-state conditions. This structural feature can be correlated with NOx decomposition product distribution. The identification of structures involved in the formation of products over bulk oxide catalysts such as Mn0.1CuxCo­O4throughoperandoXAS characterization is expected to provide deeper insights into catalyst design and enhance direct NO decomposition activity.",

The Brønsted acid density and synergy between Pt and WOx, especially in the inverse structure, are critical to reactivity and selectivity. However, a clear molecular-level understanding of the formation and dynamics of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) is lacking. Here, usingin-situspectroscopic characterizations (Raman and FTIR), chemical probing (CO chemisorption and pyridine titration), density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, and a model reaction (tert-butanol dehydration), we demonstrate the structural evolution of WOxspecies and associated BAS dynamics in various environments.In-situRaman and DFT calculations show that below monolayer coverage, the WOxspecies stay as isolated monomers on the SiO2support and W3Oxtrimers on Pt. The W3Oxtrimers on Pt are more active toward dehydration than those on the SiO2support. H2plays a complex role: at low temperatures, it creates more BAS by reversible hydrogen spillover, and at higher temperatures it partially reduces the W3Ox. This study provides a strategy for tuning Brønsted acid density and regenerating sites by pretreatment and catalyst composition.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn-situX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is frequently used to determine structure-activity relationships of catalysts. However, designing anin-situXAS experiment is complicated by many factors such as (i) micromolar quantities of the active metal in the quantity of the catalyst in the experimental cell, (ii) catalyst particle sizes vary compared to lab based experiments, (iii) the time it takes to purge out a reactive environment, and (iv) the quantity of impurities found in dead volumes of the flow system are on the same order magnitude as the active metal. To determine how the factors above may influence the dynamics of our system, we have evaluated how our flow system and reactor that is installed at the beamline compares from a mass transport and gas purity standards to reactors set up in labs for catalyst kinetics characterization allowing us to improve operations and better designin-situXAS experiments. External and internal particle diffusion were calculated for some example catalysts. Mass transport equations were solved, and the result was used to predict the concentration of gas impurities throughout the Co-ACCESS flow system as a function of number of flow controllers used. Modeling of our 6-gas ambient pressure flow system in its basic operation (6 lines sequentially connected to form one outlet), we have investigated what type of flow regimes we have for the process gas feed entering the cell, and how long it takes to purge different sections of the system to reach desired gas purities. Based upon these results we have developed new flow patterns to reduce the effects of time associated with switching gas streams, low Reynolds numbers, and minimizing effects of dead volumes while also investigating causes of subtle changes in the XAS spectra based upon time on stream.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNuclear fusion reactions power the Sun and stars where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium and energy1. The Sun’s gravitational force creates the right conditions for fusion, however making fusion happen on earth is difficult. There are many engineering challenges to successfully fuse hydrogen fuel including extreme temperatures, breeding the tritium for the deuterium-tritium fuel mixture, confining the hydrogen plasma and the vast amounts of energy that must be input to begin the fusion reactions. One additional challenge is the formation of 0.1-5% concentrations of tritiated ammonia2which could be stored as it has a relatively short half-life, however, it is more advantageous to decompose the ammonia into nitrogen and tritium and recycle the tritium into the reactor.We investigated ruthenium-based catalysts for decomposition of small concentrations of tritiated ammonia. A design of experiment was utilized to optimize an ammonia decomposition catalyst formula previously reported by our group3. After optimization, we tested the catalyst for decomposition activity in concentrations of ammonia <5% balanced in both argon and hydrogen at atmospheric pressure and temperatures between 250-450°C. Chemical stability of the catalyst was determined by measuring the activity of the catalyst before and after exposure to low concentrations of oxygen, water vapor and carbon dioxide which are the primary products of fusion process impurities. Additionally, the catalyst was thermally cycled to see the effect on the activity. Finally, the catalysts were tested in isotopic ammonia to ascertain isotopic effects of the reaction. This work led to an understanding of decomposing tritiated ammonia that will be present in every magnetically confined fusion reactor.Wilson, J.; et al.Fusion Technology.2019,75(8), 802–809.Gill, J.

    "abstract": "AbstractAn important chemistry in the toolkit for the efficient conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels and chemicals is aldolization, a C-C bond forming reaction often carried out over solid acids or bases. Mixed metal oxides derived from layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are among the most catalytically active and tunable solid bases which can enable these reactions. Thermal decomposition yields particularly active materials which have properties that can be adjusted in a variety of ways such as the metal composition. While these materials have been studied for some time, much of the work toward understanding C-C bond forming reactions on these materials lacks clear connections between structural properties, intrinsic catalytic performance, and quantum chemical theories.In this work we synthesized Mg-Al mixed oxides with varying Mg:Al molar ratios via the thermal decomposition of alkali-free layered double hydroxide precursors and examined them in the liquid-phase aldolization of acetone as a model reaction. Thermal and structural characterizations demonstrate the requirements for LDH decomposition without causing structural collapse. Reactivity trends and identification of active sites are examined via data-fitted reaction kinetics models and discussed in connection with ex-situ and in-situ site titration experiments as well as infrared spectroscopy and reversible poisoning experiments. Additional details are gathered via density functional theory (DFT) simulations of acetone aldolization over model MgxAlOysurfaces. These simulations suggest that the doping of Al creates metal vacancies which act as strong base sites. Consistent with experiment, these strongly basic sites are shown to be crucial to aldolization and help to explain the high sensitivity of aldolization rates to Mg:Al molar ratios in these mixed oxides. These studies guide future work toward developing materials comprising more exotic metal combinations in order to improve the selectivity and reactivity of heterogeneous aldolization reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractResearch involving transition metal catalysts continues to be a prominent area of study as eliminating noble metals offers cheaper, and more sustainable opportunities for industry. Ni-based catalysts play a large role in heterogenous catalysts for many applications in both the petrochemical and syngas industries. Often in an industrial environment, characterization methods such as X-ray florescence (XRF) are employed due to ease of use, availability, and cost of operation. However, catalyst production is often a difficult, multi-step process where slight variations in process conditions could lead to product variability that may not be detected in simpler techniques such as XRF. In some cases, a fundamental understanding of the structure-function relationship is essential to fine-tune a catalyst design. In this work, we studied a model Ni-Al2O3based system to gain a deeper understanding of parameters affecting catalyst performance. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the different states of Ni present on the catalyst surface with slight variations in production steps. A correlation was developed between Ni-state and catalyst performance, and the learnings were applied to the streamlined production of current Ni product offerings.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe high operating temperature and the presence of high percentages of water vapor in aftertreatment systems lead to the loss of activity due to the agglomeration of the active components. Plus, the accumulation over time of the residual sulfur of the fuel has a detrimental effect on the aftertreatment system performance due to the strong chemisorption of sulfur species on the catalyst surface. Resistance to SO2poisoning depends on the precious metal (PM) and support used in the catalyst composition. Taking a closer look to the interactions between SO2and noble metals, previous studies have shown that PM particle size greatly influences what type of sulfur species form on the catalyst surface in Al2O3-supported catalysts: smaller particle size form a greater amount of high temperature aluminum sulfate species, while catalysts with larger particle sizes form a greater amount of low temperature sulfur species, such as molecular SO2and aluminum sulfite species [1]. To alleviate the effects of agglomeration at high temperatures, exposure to hydrothermal treatments leads to the redispersion of clustered Pd nanoparticles which resulted in the improved activity and stability of the catalyst. Plus, this treatment led to improved resistance to SO2poisoning [2]. In this study, we evaluated the SO2interactions on colloidal Pd-based catalysts with 2.9 and 10 nm particle sizes after hydrothermal treatments, and the Pd particle size after H2O + SO2exposure was assessed by TEM and CO pulse injection.References[1] Wilburn, M.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe selective catalytic oxidation of NH3(NH3-SCO) is an efficient route to remove NH3from the NH3slip of vehicle emission control. Supported metal catalysts such as Pt, Pd and Cu catalysts are widely reported, but the high cost and high N2O yield limited their application [1]. Ag, with relatively low price and superior catalytic activity, recently attracted great attention and showed high potential for NH3-SCO reaction. However, to date, very few works have reported the preparation and application of Ag single atom catalysts (Ag1SACs) for NH3-SCO reaction, particularly the effect of supports on Ag coordination environments and catalytic performance.We herein report the preparation and application of Ag catalysts with 1wt.% Ag loading on three different supports including CeO2, Al2O3and ZrO2for NH3-SCO reaction. By means of TEM, UV-vis DRS and EXAFS, it was verified that Ag is present as single atom phase within all the three catalysts. Under different testing conditions with or without H2O, NH3-SCO activity on the catalysts decreased by the order of Ag1/CeO2> Ag1/ZrO2> Ag1/Al2O3(Figure 1), with the Ag1/CeO2catalyst performing the best. H2-temperature programed reduction (H2-TPR) results indicated that Ag1/CeO2exhibited the best low-temperature reducibility. In accompanying density functional theory-based calculation, we believe that the greatest advantage offered by the Ag SACs on CeO2is the formation of hydrogen bonds between NH3and surface oxygen atoms, providing a drastically smaller activation energy barrier corresponding to shorter distances required for the hydrogen to dissociate.References:[1].

    "abstract": "AbstractCu ions exchanged into small-pore Chabazite (CHA) zeolites facilitate the selective catalytic reduction of NOxwith NH3in diesel aftertreatment systems. However, they unintentionally produce nitrous oxide (N2O); N2O is an ozone-depleting substance and the third most deleterious greenhouse gas (GHG). Thus, new catalytic technologies are urgently needed to simultaneously mitigate NOxand N2O emissions. Fe-zeolites display order-of-magnitude lower N2O emissions during NOx-SCR, and are known to activate N2O in stoichiometric partial hydrocarbon oxidation chemistries. Yet, the mechanisms by which Fe-zeolites decompose N2O in SCR systems in the presence of NO and NH3(Figure 1a) remain incompletely understood.Here, we synthesize model Fe-CHA zeolite materials and investigate their reactivity towards N2O-SCR reactions involving NH3and/or NO as reductants, using steady-state kinetics and redox titrations. We prepared 1.1 wt% Fe-CHA (Fe/Al = 0.22) on a parent H-form CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 12), and validated the exclusive presence of Fe ions using UV-visible spectroscopy and NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD). Steady-state reactivity measurements in a differential laboratory reactor with varying gas mixtures (T = 623 K) reveal disparate redox pathways for N2O-SCR (Figure 1b), with products quantified using an infrared analyzer. Rates of N2O-SCR in the presence of NH3are 5× higher than rates of N2O decomposition without NH3. In the presence of NH3alone, N2O is reduced via Eqn. 1, implying a redox cycle with N2O as oxidant and NH3as reductant. In the presence of NO and NH3, N2O consumption occurs via a linear combination of two competitive redox pathways, Eqn. 1 (NH3redundant) and Eqn. 2 (NO and NH3co-reductants). Redox titrations and reaction order measurements validate the proposed redox cycle and indicate that oxidation is rate-limiting. Our findings provide fundamental insights into N2O-SCR redox pathways over metal-zeolites for GHG emissions control.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIncreased water consumption with concomitant surging water pollution drive a continued need to improve the efficacy of wastewater treatment. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), consisting of modular networks of organic linkers coordinated to metal-containing nodes, are potential materials for application in the adsorptive and oxidative removal of aqueous pollutants. MOFs made from earth-abundant metals, particularly iron (Fe), are attractive given their low toxicity and metal cost and have demonstrated water pollutant degradation.[1] This work focuses on hydrogen peroxide oxidation of methylene blue, a medication and dye, to understand connections between structure and function of Fe-based MOFs in the catalytic removal of pollutants pertinent to industrial effluent as well as limitations of MOFs in aqueous phase systems broadly. Under excess oxidant conditions, MIL-101(Fe) demonstrates a lumped first order rate constant (normalized by total Fe) three times that of a contrasting Fe-terephthalate with the same secondary building units in different crystallographic arrangement (MTN zeotype vs. acs topology, respectively), [2,3] possibly indicating disparate ligands coordinated to metal nodes. However, significant structural changes are evident, including loss in crystallinity and apparent iron leaching, even though the catalysts continue to demonstrate degradative reactivity upon recovery and reuse. Moreover, leaching occurs even when catalyst is exposed to water in the absence of reactants; thus, solvent interactions drive material changes that require careful interpretation to clarify the nature of active sites and reactivity. In contrast, MIL-100(Fe), isostructural to MIL-101(Fe) but constructed from a different carboxylate linker, demonstrates similar degrative reactivity to these Fe-terephthalate MOFs after thermal activation but without apparent leaching of active species, suggesting its potential for longer catalyst lifetime. This exemplifies the need to understand the timescale and extent of structural changes during reaction to properly contextualize material performance across aqueous oxidation catalysts.Referenceshttps://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b02563https://doi.org/10.1021/cm051870ohttps://doi.org/10.1039/d1mh01663f",

    "abstract": "AbstractSyngas, a combination of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2), is a precursor to many chemicals and fuels, contributing to the billion-dollar global hydrocarbon industry. Chemical looping reforming (CLR) of the greenhouse gases – methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) allows for energy-efficient production of syngas. 5wt.% nickel (Ni) on ceria-zirconia (5wt%Ni@Ce0.6Zr0.4O2) mixed metal oxide catalyst was investigated here to explore the pathways for sustained syngas production without deactivating the catalyst. The CLR of CH4with CO2was conducted on varying redox states of the catalyst. In order to elucidate the reaction performance dependence on the intrinsic surface redox states of the catalyst, we performed several operando studies –in-situFourier transform spectroscopy, andin-situRaman spectroscopy. Most importantly, the effect of surface concentration of methane-activated carbon, and oxygen vacancies on the intrinsic kinetics of syngas production was probed in the Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) reactor. With the gas-gas interactions eliminated under TAP-operational regimes, the experimental data solely reflects the effect of gas-catalyst interactions. This high-volume (millisecond resolution) data containing intrinsic surface interaction insights was decomposed into independent surface interaction modes through advanced statistical models. These intrinsic reaction performance insights, coupled with bulk and surface characterization of the catalysts provide a deeper understanding of the surface processes, as the catalysts evolve dynamically under CLR conditions. Syngas production was reported for over 10 cycles of CLR with CH4and CO2conversions higher than 90%, with a CO selectivity of more than 90% as well. Elucidation of this dynamic evolution of surface species on the catalyst and their intricate structure-function relationship will aid in designing reaction protocols for enhanced CLR reaction performance.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCobalt-based catalysts excel as oxidation catalysts in numerous environmental applications, such as emission control of unburned methane, VOC and toxic chemicals. The active phase of cobalt oxide on the surface, Co3O4, supplies oxygen through facile conversion between the two cobalt ion oxidation states (Co3+and Co2+), thereby possessing remarkable redox properties. Supported cobalt oxides on porous substrates typically form diminutive Co3O4crystallites, while its strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) may adversely impact the oxide phase transition. For example, when alumina serves as the support, SMSI provokes partial reduction of Co3+ions to Co2+and immobilizes them within the alumina lattice, generating cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) or cobalt surface phase (CSP) species with limited redox property and being relatively inactive at low temperatures. This phase distribution is an unavoidable consequence during the calcination process; however, from a fundamental perspective, since the metal-support interaction significantly impacts the surface properties of the support, a potential solution lies in modifying the surface of the support.This research proposes a highly active Co/Al2O3catalyst acquired through surface modification of γ-Al2O3. We have confirmed that a simple and practical water removal method could induce the formation and utilization of γ-Al2O3surface defects. The cobalt oxide interacting with defects on alumina surface forms the Co3O4phase more selectively, significantly enhancing catalytic activity. Figure 1a demonstrates the superior oxidation activity of the developed catalyst compared to reference catalysts prepared by the typical impregnation method. This also aligns well with the H2-TPR profiles, presenting the Co3O4phase formed on the surface of the developed catalyst (Figure 1b). We will provide more detailed data on synthesis, designing strategy and its verification at the upcoming AIChE meeting.",

Investigate new processes for sustainable hydrogen storage is fundamental to enable fast and capillary diffusion of H2technologies. However, at present, mature H2storage technologies, i.e. high-pressure and/or cryogenic liquid H2, still present many limitations and safety issues, also affecting public perception and acceptance of H2-powered devices. H2release and uptake through cyclic interconversion of formate/bicarbonate aqueous solutions (Figure) at near-ambient conditions is an intrinsically safe and easy-to-handle storage system. Preliminary energetic assessment suggest that the available catalysts could meet the requirements for mobile applications in the automotive sector with storage tanks in the range of 200 L, with an energetic efficiency of about 72%, improvable up to 90%, depending on reaction temperature and pressure. From a thermodynamic point of view the reaction can be easily shifted at near ambient conditions (T = 20-90 °C; P = 1-30 atm) by slightly changing the operating conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBased on our prior knowledge that CuO based catalysts exhibited superior catalytic performance in NO reduction by CO [1], CuO/Al2O3serial catalysts with different CuO loadings (xwt.% CuO/Al2O3, denoted asxCu/Al) were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method and evaluated for the possible NH3production from NO, CO and H2O. With the increase of CuO loadings from 1 to 12 wt.%, monotonically increased NO removal efficiency was achieved onxCu/Al catalysts under dry condition (Fig. 1a). However, when 5 vol.% H2O was added to the feeding stream, the NO conversion on 5Cu/Al increased significantly, achieving almost the same level as that on 12Cu/Al (Fig. 1b). Abundant NH3was formed onxCu/Al catalysts with the addition of H2O to the feeding stream (Fig. 1c and 1d). The NH3generation on 5Cu/Al was the most vigorous, which started at the lowest temperature (275oC). The efficient conversion of NO to NH3and the possible reaction between NH3and NO should be the main reason for the noticeable enhancement of NO reduction efficiency on 5Cu/Al in the presence of H2O. Unlike that isolated Cu ions or crystalline CuO particles were formed on CuO/Al2O3catalysts with lower (≤ 3 wt.%) or higher (≥ 7 wt.%) CuO loadings, respectively, highly dispersed CuOxclusters were formed on 5Cu/Al. The highly dispersed CuOxclusters with superior redox performance could better facilitate the activation/dissociation of H2O to react with NO and CO, forming NH3and CO2. This work provides a new strategy for NH3production from two common air pollutants with the assistance of H2O on economic CuO/Al2O3catalysts under mild reaction conditions.References:[1] W. Tan, Y.

    "abstract": "AbstractBiomass valorization is a method of producing commodity chemicals from renewable materials by selectively cleaving bonds. The dehydrogenation of biomass-derived alcohols has recently gained interest as a way of producing value-added carbonyl compounds as well as H2. In addition to several transition metal alloys, molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) catalysts have been identified as promising materials for this reaction. Furthermore, other reactions of alcohols including reforming and dehydration on metal-modified Mo2N model surfaces have been studied as important steps in biomass upgrading. Therefore, in this work, the tunable selectivity of Fe-, Cu-, and Pt-modified Mo2N model surfaces and powder catalysts was investigated using an isopropanol probe molecule, which has additional interest as a liquid organic hydrogen carrier. The model surface results showed clear trends in the selectivity toward decomposition, dehydration, and dehydrogenation that were dependent on both the type and coverage of the metal overlayer. These findings were then correlated with those on powder catalysts using reactor experiments and in situ synchrotron techniques to demonstrate how studies of model surfaces can inform the design of supported catalysts. This work shows that fundamental information about the reactivity and intermediates on Mo2N-based model surfaces can be applied to understand the activity of metal-modified Mo2N powder catalysts, and further demonstrates that these catalysts have potential for upgrading biomass-derived oxygenates.",

Fixed bed reactor kinetic studies indicated fractional reaction rate orders of ethanol and oxygen of 0.52-0.72 and 0.31-0.36, respectively, and minimum promoting/co-adsorption effect of co-fed water. Isotopic ethanol experiments also evidenced the equilibrated dissociative adsorption of ethanol and a rate determining step (rds) dominated by the C-H cleavage of the ethoxy group. In situ UV-vis spectroscopy of Au plasmon shifts revealed that oxygen species adsorb preferentially at the Au-TiO2support interface. A combination of operando UV-vis spectrokinetic analysis (from d-d transitions in the 900-100 nm region) of various charge transfer (CT) kinetic models combined with net CT changes derived from DFT calculations of adsorbed species on a Au5/Ti(101) surface ruled out molecular oxygen as active species in the rate limiting step, revealed adsorption of ethanol on Au and confirmed stabilization of oxygen species at the Au-TiO2interface. Additionally, in situ isotopic ethanol-d6 modulation excitation--diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy showed the presence of hydroxyls and ethanol derived intermediate species adsorbed on the Au/TiO2surface. Overall, these results provide strong experimental and theoretical evidence for a kinetic model where ethanol adsorbs dissociatively on Au and diffuses near the Au-support interface where the ethoxide reacts with oxygen active species to form acetaldehyde in a rate limiting step. Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate expressions based on dual active sites (Au and Au-TiO2interface) where oxygen active species are composed of atomic O* (derived from HOO*), HO*, or HOO* species were found to be consistent with the UV-vis and DRIFTS spectroscopic and DFT calculation results while correlating well with the fixed bed reactor experimental observations at the studied reaction conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAu-based catalysts readily oxidize and reduce small molecules (e.g., CO, H2, O2) and organic substrates at metal-support interfaces, often with the assistance of water molecules. Herein, we investigate how the support identity and size of Au nanoparticles affect transformations of H–H, O–O, and O–H bonds during reactions of H2and O2at the solid-liquid-support interfaces of Au-based catalysts.Figure 1ashows that rates of H2activation are 1-2 orders of magnitude greater on Au nanoparticles supported on metal oxides (e.g., TiO2) compared to more inert materials like carbon and BN, suggesting oxygen functions (e.g., O-H) assist H–H activation. Similarly, basic and reducible metal oxides (e.g., Au-La2O3) favor O–O bond cleavage (16-22 kJ mol-1), while more inert and acidic interfaces (e.g., Au-SiO2) obstruct O–O dissociation (72-85 kJ mol-1) and improve selectivity to H2O2. Moreover, H2O2selectivities increase as the fraction of sites at the Au-support interface decrease relative to metallic sites far from this interface, improving H2O2selectivity on larger Au nanoparticles (2-25 nm).Figure 1bshows that rates of H2O2formation increase linearly with H2pressure and are independent of O2pressure on Au-TiO2, suggesting O2-derived species saturate active sites. Moreover, rates of HD scrambling are one order of magnitude lower than rates of H2O2formation, indicating irreversible adsorption and activation of H2and D2. Such findings agree with decreased oxygen reduction rates when using D2instead of H2(kH/kD = 1.5), implicating kinetically relevant H–H dissociation during H2O2formation. Still,Figure 1cshows that H2O2only forms within protic solvents, indicating H2O2forms by proton transfer steps. Yet, rates are equal within H2O and D2O, implying proton transfer is kinetically irrelevant. These findings suggest that solid-liquid-support interfaces catalyze proton-electron transfer reactions of H2, O2, and H2O, limited by H–H activation steps.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe potential of benzene and alkyl-substituted arenes as vehicles for H2storage via hydrogenation and subsequent release in dehydrogenation processes has restored interest in hydrogenation catalysis on metal surfaces. This work addresses unresolved mechanistic questions for these reactions surrounding the negative rate dependence on temperature and increasing kinetic orders in H2and arenes at higher temperatures. Turnover rates for methylcyclohexane (MCH) formation from toluene-H2reactants were measured on SiO2-supported Pt nanoparticles. Turnover rates for MCH formation decreased exponentially with temperature above 490 K (Figure 1a); these rates showed a dependence on H2pressure that exceeded a second-order trend and a near one-half order dependence on toluene pressure. 1-Methylcyclohexene (1MCHE) and 4-methylcyclohexene (4MCHE) isomers were also observed at low but detectable pressures (<1 Pa). Their approach to equilibrium (η) was >0.5 at temperatures >490 K (Figure 1b), consistent with their formation from toluene-H2reactants in a sequence of quasi-equilibrated steps. Plane-wave density-functional theory calculations (performed on Pt(111) slabs) were used to determine the changes in free energies required to form surface species present as intermediates in ring-hydrogenation routes, thus informing coverages of Pt-nanoparticle surfaces under reaction conditions. A mechanism-based kinetic model consistent with computational and experimental observations reveals that rates at higher temperatures become limited by reactions that convert MCHE isomers to MCH. The chemical processes that form transition states for these kinetically relevant steps from toluene-H2reactants on crowded Pt surfaces occur exothermically, resulting in a negative apparent activation energy that underpins the negative rate dependences on temperature. These insights encourage bifunctional catalysts that leverage cascade reactions involving equilibrated MCHE isomers and catalyst developments that increase rates of kinetically relevant MCHE hydrogenation steps at higher temperatures.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPreviously, we have demonstrated that even with the normalization of the particle size, surface area, and gold loading (i.e., surface turnover frequency), the gold nanoparticles (with a bare surface) in the small pores of mesoporous silica (26.4 s-1)are more active in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol molecules (C6H5CH2OH) than those on the amorphous silica (20.7s-1). This indicates that the pore structure enhances catalysis. Furthermore, we have developed a nuclear resonance magnetic (NMR) based characterization to probe the molecules’ motions (i.e., translation & rotation) near the gold surface. The small pores are shown to restrain the random rotation of the molecules and do not induce mass-transfer (i.e., translation) limitations. We have hypothesized that the restrained rotation optimizes the adsorption of the reagent (i.e., benzyl alcohol) on the gold surface, ultimately improving the catalysts’ activity. The ‘unfavorable’ adsorption of the reagent (i.e., C6H5-) is expected to block the active sites on the gold surface and hinder catalysis. Since the direct investigation of adsorption is difficult in liquids, the hypothesis is tested by measuring the desorption energy of C6­H5- (represented by benzene) in theporous/nonporoussilica via temperature-programmed desorption. It is further tested by measuring the heat (i.e., enthalpy) evolved during the solid-liquid interactions while immersing the gold nanoparticles supported by theporous/nonporoussilica in liquid benzene via immersion calorimetry. Compared tononporoussilica, a lower enthalpy of immersion and a reduction in the desorption energy are observed in theporoussilica. These results indicate that within the porous silica, the restrained rotation of the phenyl rings can reduce the degrees of freedom of ‘unfavorable’ adsorption on the gold surface and weaken the binding strength required to separate the adsorbed phenyl rings from the gold surface, creating more available reaction sites and facilitating a successful reaction.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo improve the efficiency of renewable biofuel, the oxygen content must be removed. This occurs via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), where the oxygens bonded to the aromatics within the fuel are catalytically cleaved by reacting with hydrogen, producing water as a byproduct.Density Functional Theory (DFT)-based work on the HDO of phenol on Fe shows that the presence of water decreases the corresponding activation barriers by facilitating the tautomerization pathway—metal- or water-assisted (Fig 1A)—which can lead to ring saturation.Literature suggests that the co-adsorption of an alkali metal (Cs, K, Na) can mitigate ring saturation by influencing the tautomerization pathway.DFT results found that water molecules preferentially bind to Cs compared to Fe, suggesting a likelihood of watermolecules forming around the Cs atom. The adsorption energy of water per molecule decreases as more water molecules are adsorbed up to the saturation point. This trend is consistent regardless of the cation (Fig 1B), where it was further determined that the co-adsorption of alkalis and water decreases as the cation size increases (Na>K>Cs). The differential charge analysis (Fig 1C) indicates an increasing amount of charge transfer from the cation to Fe (Na<K<Cs), consistent with the larger Na-system adsorption energies. This stronger adsorption is attributed to the smaller size of the Na cation, leading to shorter water-Na bond distances and constricting of the cation-water network, which limits the charge transfer from Na to Fe.The reaction pathways are illuminated via the Nudge Elastic Band (NEB) method, where the adsorption energies of the initial, intermediary, and final steps indicate a high energy barrier to remove the hydrogen from the -OH group of phenol.Results from this study will aid in the understanding of the dual impact of local electric fields and solvent environments on a vital HDO mechanism to upgrade biofuels.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEthylene oxide (EO, C2H4O) is an intermediate used in synthesis of pharmaceutical ingredients, detergents, and polymers. Industrially, EO is synthesized throughthe partial oxidation of ethylene over silver (Ag) supported on low surface area α-Al2O3. The main figure of merit for this reaction is theselectivity, which is hindered by total oxidation of ethylene into carbon dioxide (CO2). Despite the industrial maturity of this reaction, there are still many unanswered questions into the form(s) of selective oxygen(s) involved in this chemistry.1In this contribution, we utilize a combination of first principles density functional theory (DFT) modelling augmented by machine learning andin operandosurface enhanced Raman spectroscopy2coupled with data science techniques to shed light on the mechanism of ethylene epoxidation. Machine learning augmented DFT modelling reveals that multiple oxygen motifs are stable and co-present under ethylene epoxidation conditions and that ethylene oxide selectivity appears to be higher over motifs with high concentrations of oxygen.In operandoSERSon commercial-mimic Ag/Al2O3catalysts under relevant operating conditions provide spectroscopic evidence for the presence of multiple atomic and molecular oxygen species.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe design of heterogeneous catalysts can be accelerated by identifying relevant descriptors that accurately and effectively link binding and activation energies to reactivity. Herein, we have investigated scaling relations between binding energies of various hydrocarbon-based adsorbates on three different Pt surfaces and the metal binding energies (ΔEM)estimated via the recently developedα-scheme model. The coordination basedα-scheme model can predict ΔEMvery accurately and efficiently. The predicted ΔEMshows strong correlation with the hydrocarbon-based metal adsorbate and adsorbate binding energies (ΔEPt-Aand ΔEA). We find that the scaling slopes are similar for certain groups of adsorbates which then can be classified based on their spatial and electronic structure. The binding energies of simple hydrocarbons CHx, x={0,1,2,3,4} and CHCH2can be used to identify the binding energies of more complex hydrocarbon-based adsorbates as scaling relations slopes of ΔEPt-Aand ΔEAvs.ΔEPtfor higher hydrocarbons are similar with these adsorbates. Since various classes are linearly correlated with CH it can be used as a simple descriptor for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. These are correlated with ΔEPtwhich can be obtained from theα-scheme model (Figure). We introduce this classification to establish a generalizable scheme in which complex hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes of higher hydrocarbons can be predicted via the binding energies of simpler hydrocarbon-based species and ultimately through the surface site stabilities.Slight differences in the reaction energies for various hydrocarbons are due to the difference in the linear scaling intercepts which can be explained from differences in bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the C–H bond for the various hydrocarbon intermediates. By using these approaches, it is possible to obtain the reaction energies for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons on Pt. We believe that the established correlations and classifications will be useful for accurate and efficient screening of a large number of catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWaste cooling oils typically contain triglycerides, long chain fatty acids, and other oxidation products. Hence, in terms of molecular size and carbon chain length, waste cooking oil (WCO) is a suitable raw material for lubricant production. However, the biolubricants produced via (trans)esterification, etherification, and C=C epoxidation of WCO have one or more negative characteristics such as poor flow properties, low oxidation stability, and insufficient solubility of additives. This study presents a novel approach to produce biolubricants from the reaction of WCO and cyclic oxygenated hydrocarbons (cyclopentanone, cyclopentanol, anisole, and 2-methylfuran) via a four-step pathway including hydrolysis, dehydration, Friedel−Crafts (FC) acylation/alkylation, and hydrotreatment. The process resulted in the production of biolubricants with unique molecular structure that are consisted of a long chain with one or two naphthenic ring(s) attached to it. These structures share several positive properties: 1) long and linear hydrocarbon chains can provide good lubricity (by reducing the boundary friction coefficient) and viscosity index (VI), 2) low-to-zero unsaturation to give improved stability to the mixture, 3) minimal branching that may lower wearing rate, 4) the presence of a naphthenic rings to increase oxidation resistance, boost solvency capacity (thus, improve its response to additives), decrease viscosity variations with temperature (increase VI), and lower the pour point (PP), and 5) high polarity to ensure a good boundary layer with a metal surface. We showed that such biolubricants can be synthesized with pour-point, kinematic viscosity (at 40°C), viscosity index, and Noack volatility of −12°C, 47.5 cP, 186, and 17 wt.%, respectively. Furthermore, a major challenge associated with bio-lubricants is their solvency capacity for additives and their poor miscibility in petroleum-lubricants. We have demonstrated that the bio-lubricant produced via our method is fully miscible with VHVI-6 (a commercial base fluid with no additives) and 0W-20 full synthetic engine oil.",

    "abstract": "AbstractReducing our dependence on petroleum-derived chemicals requires the development of renewable alternatives to replace these established products. Recent investigations demonstrated a pathway to prepare 4,4’-dimethylbiphenyl (DMBP) from available biomass precursors, an attractive platform chemical for producing metal-organic frameworks, plasticizers, and polymers.The synthesis of renewable DMBP follows a two-step process: 2-methylfuran (MF) is oxidatively coupled to yield 5,5’-dimethylbifuran (DMBF). DMBF then undergoes tandem Diels-Alder and dehydration with ethylene to afford the desired DMBP. Prior research identified conditions that achieved 63% MF conversion and 59% DMBF yield, leaving room for improvements in DMBP production. We researched process and catalyst alternatives to improve the productivity of this valuable molecule.A baseline DMBF space-time yield of 0.59 mol L-1h-1was established via the reaction conditions initially reported. A surface response design identified an initial optimum at 44 °C and a MF/solvent molar ratio of 0.713, achieving a DMBF space-time yield of 0.75 mol L-1h-1. Temperature effects at the optimum MF/solvent ratio showed that as the reaction reaches complete conversion of MF, DMBF reacts to form undesired byproducts. For maximum productivity, the reaction time was reduced to 1.5 hours at a temperature of 67 °C affording a MF conversion of 96.2% and DMBF yield of 77.5% with a DMBF space-time yield of 1.10 mol L-1h-1, an 86.4% increase from the baseline.For the second step, the use of homogenous Lewis acid catalysts in the Diels-Alder-Dehydration reaction demonstrated a 39.2% increase in DMBP yield compared to the initial protocols. We will report on our continuing efforts to develop an effective and scalable pathway to renewable DMBP, to identify the reaction mechanisms of the desired and undesired side reactions as well as the scale up of the process.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP), as well as other polyolefins, is a method for the conversion of plastic waste to valuable fuels and chemicals. The temperature needed for PP pyrolysis can be decreased with the addition of HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be inherently mixed with PP and other polyolefins in multilayer packaging. PET is known to cause issues with catalyst deactivation, as it results in a high coke yields. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is a tool which can be used to determine the degradation profiles of polymers during catalytic pyrolysis. In previous TGA work, it was observed that during the catalytic co-pyrolysis of LDPE and PET with HZSM-5, that PET was delaying the degradation of LDPE. These interactions between the two polymers were able to be modelled using an nth-order lumped reaction scheme.The reaction scheme used in our previous study was used to model experiments conducted with a TGA for the catalytic co-pyrolysis of PP and PET with HZSM-5. The number of experiments fitted to the kinetic model increased from 6 in our previous work to 26 in this work by varying more the catalyst:feedstock ratio, heating rate, and the PP:PET ratio, ultimately leading to a more robust set of kinetic parameters. Certain trends observed experimentally, such as an increased solid residual yield for higher catalyst:feedstock ratios, were also observed in the model. Used catalysts were characterized by pyridine temperature programmed desorption (Pyr-TPD), and a loss of acidity up to ca. 50% was observed, depending on the PP:PET ratio used. Subsequent pyrolysis experiments conducted with used catalysts showed significant changes in maximum degradation temperature, up to ca. 200K. Building a robust model which is also including catalyst deactivation phenomena, will allow us to better understand how PET can be included as a pyrolysis feedstock alongside polyolefins.",

Further investigation into the catalytic degradation of PFAAs in water revealed that the HTL method, assisted by basic catalysts, significantly accelerates and enhances the degradation process. This study highlights the potential of the HTL method in addressing PFAS contamination in water and soil.The rapid catalytic HTL data offer valuable insights for developing a continuous HTL system for PFAS treatment, as well as informing the integration of phytoremediation and treatment of these persistent \"forever chemicals.\" The findings emphasize the promise of the HTL method in mitigating the environmental impacts of PFAS contamination and contribute to the ongoing efforts to develop effective remediation strategies.",

Conventionally, Starbons® are produced using a high-amylose-content starch (Hylon®VII) which guarantees a high mesopore volume due to the arrangement of amylose molecules during the synthesis.Looking for valorizing waste streams, and using second generation raw materials, the exploitation of waste starches is of interest for industrial applications. Particularly, these are produced in high volumes during the transformation of potato and cassava in the stacks industry, their manufacture, and the whole supply chain. According to Colombian National Planning Department, nearly 5 million ton of roots and tubers are produced in Colombia, nevertheless, almost 30% are discarded because of quality standards. Such materials could be valorized extracting starches and transforming them into value-added products such as biobased catalysts.In this regard, this work focused on understanding and optimizing Starbon® materials obtention from low-amylose-starches, such as potato and cassava. The synthesis involves a sol-gel-method in which the conditions for the gelatinization, retrogradation, solvent exchange and carbonization were assessed. Therefore, synthesis parameters were defined for getting higher mesoporosity and surface areas in the low-amylose-starch-derived Starbons®. The obtained materials were characterized by nitrogen sorption, exhibiting a surface area of around 250 m2/g, average pore width between 8 nm and 10 nm, and mesoporous fraction of approximately 80%. These properties allow its used as supporting structures for heterogeneous catalysts in reactions which involve large molecules.

    "abstract": "AbstractUltrasound waves propagating through aqueous media induce the inertial cavitation of suspended cavities driving homolysis of di- or poly-atomic species to form radical fragments (e.g. H• and •OH). The radical products dissolve into solution where they initiate aqueous reactions of organic substrates. Such ultrasound processes require only apiezoelectricmaterial, electricity, and use water as the solvent presenting a promising route for sustainable chemical synthesis. The properties of the solvent (e.g. density, surface tension, viscosity) influence the rates of momentum transfer between the gas and liquid thus affecting cavitation dynamics and amounts of radicals formed. The sensitivity of radical yield and thermodynamic efficiency of inertial cavitation processes to solvent properties were investigated by solving mass, energy, and momentum balance laws that simulate the dynamics of isolated O2/Ar bubbles evolving in a H2O bath with ultrasound irradiation. Figure 1 shows the change in the formation rate of free radicals during cavitation upon small increases (1%) in the values of experimental conditions, physical parameters of the solvent, and acoustic parameters. Radical formation rates decreased as values of solvent properties increased, and became more sensitive to changes to the solvent as the acoustic frequency increased. These solvent parameters also affected rates within the same order of magnitude as acoustic parameters, indicating that decreasing their values (by, for instance, diluting H2O with lower-density solvents or adding surfactants to lower the surface tension) can influence radical formation to a similar extent. The effects of solvent properties on radical formation rates elucidate the influence of dissolved organics in aqueous solution on cavitation properties with implications for chemical synthesis in ultrasound reactors. These trends moreover inform design strategies that leverage solvent properties to maximize radical yield from cavitation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMicrokinetic models (MKMs) have become an essential tool for understanding reaction mechanisms and designing new catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Accurate thermodynamic data for surface species is crucial for developing reliable MKMs. In this study, we explored different methods for generating thermodynamic data for species involved in catalytic methane partial oxidation (CMPO) on rhodium, an important reaction used in various industrial processes.We generated a MKM for CMPO on rhodium with the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), using linear scaling relationships (LSRs) to estimate the surface species’ thermodynamic parameters based on the species enthalpy for platinum. We then compared the thermochemical data generated by LSRs with parameters generated by two alternative methods: the Open Catalysis Project (OCP) pretrained model and density functional theory (DFT). The OCP is a machine learning model trained to predict the adsorption energies of molecules on transition metal surfaces. The thermodynamic data generated by the OCP and DFT were compared with LSR values, and the three sets of thermodynamic data were used to simulate the CMPO process on rhodium. The simulations were performed in Cantera, and the results were compared to the experimental data.To quantify each method's uncertainty, we used the Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification for Science and Engineering (PEUQSE) package. PEUQSE was used to estimate the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) values for binding energy and the High Probability Density (HPD) region for the LSR, OCP, and DFT models. This revealed a feasible set and uncertainties for binding energies calculated with each of these methods.In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of accurate thermodynamic data and discusses the applicability of the pretrained neural network models in microkinetic modeling. These methods can be applied to other catalytic systems to generate more accurate microkinetic models and ultimately enable the design of more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBimetallic catalysts are known to frequently exhibit high, synergistic performance as compared to their metal constituents, which is directly related to the composition profiles in the first few atomic layers with the nanoparticles. Notably, when exposed to various reaction environments, such bimetallic nanoparticles can undergo adsorbate-induced surface segregation and reconstruction. Although such phenomena have been extensively studied by both experimental and computational approaches, there is still a lack of nanoscale insights into the adsorbate-surface and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions that drive reconstruction. Without such insights, bimetallic catalyst design that accounts for thein situsurface response to reaction environment is greatly hindered. Here, we address this challenge using a case study of Rh50Pd50nanoparticle reconstruction under cyclical oxidizing and reducing conditions. Using density functional theory (DFT), we mapped the coverage dependent O* adsorption energies and overall surface formation energies over three facets ((111), (100), (110)) and surface layer compositions (Pd enriched, mixed, Rh enriched). A microkinetic model that predicts the O* coverage and near surface structure over an entire nanoparticle surface was then constructed that incorporated the DFT energies by assuming that the nanoparticle is a paraboloid and using kubic harmonics interpolation. As shown in Figure 1, O* initially populates the (111) facet. Further increasing the gas phase O2pressure results in O* population of the (100) and (110) facets. This change in O* coverage directly corresponds to reconstruction of the nanoparticle surface, where the nanoparticle initially has a Pd enriched skin that undergoes inversion to a Rh enriched skin. Overall, our work identifies the environment and nanoscale interactions that lead to Rh50Pd50nanoparticle reconstruction, as well as establishes an approach for predicting such adsorbate induced reconstructionsa priori. This work enables the potential of tunable nanoparticle engineering induced by reactive gases as a novel catalyst design strategy.",

We show that the LDA method leads to second order population balance equations that accurately describe molecular weight evolution when applied to realistic initial molecular weight distributions. We also model tandem catalysis with one catalyst that cleaves chains at the end and one that cleaves chains at random interior locations. We show how the predicted molecular weight distributions change upon coordinate transformation to common presentations in the literature: carbon number distribution, logarithmic weight distribution, etc. Finally, we apply the model to experimental data from isomerizing ethenolysis and use the model to extract kinetic parameters.Reference1.

    "abstract": "AbstractDespite the large number of industrial processes involving non-catalytic gas-solid reactions in moving bed reactors, most existing simulations from literature considerably simplify the transport and reaction phenomena involved at the particle scale. In fact, the complex mathematical equation of such systems is derived from the transient characteristics of the solids that affect the local physical properties during the reaction. In this study, a multiscale moving-bed reactor model for non-catalytic gas-solid reactions was developed to evaluate the parameters that hierarchically affect process performance. The model considers the mass, heat, and momentum transport equations for the gas flow in porous medium and the solid particles in counter-current flow, comprising the kinetic model of multiple non-catalytic reactions that occur inside the particles. The reactor and the solid particles are discretized based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) and an extra dimension is used to simulate the particle scale coupled to the reactor scale. The model provides detailed profiles of gas and solid concentration, and temperature along the pellet radius at different reactor positions, as well as solid conversion, gas concentration, and temperature of both phases along the reactor. The multiscale model provides important information into non-catalytic solid reactions, allowing for a direct evaluation of the solid particle characteristics in the performance of industrial reactors.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSupported Pt atoms are excellent catalysts for small alkane dehydrogenation. Single atom catalysts and low nuclearity clusters are viable options as they show high activity and are atom efficient. The challenge, however, lies in stabilizing Pt atoms on supports as they tend to sinter and lose catalytic activity at high temperatures. Recently, it has been shown that encapsulating Pt clusters in microporous materials such as zeolites enhances the stability of these catalysts1. Incorporating heteroatoms such as Sn into the framework promotes homogenous dispersion of Pt clusters in the zeolite by serving as anchoring points2. We aim to use computational methods to understand the catalyst stability and activity.In this work, we first used Density-Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate all possible stable monomeric and dimeric Pt(0) species in CHA and Sn-CHA in the presence and absence of defects, namely silanol clusters and Al(III)-introduced Brønsted acid sites. For the defect-free CHA, single Pt atoms are stabilized by weakening an Si-O bond at the intersection of a 6- and 4-membered ring. In the presence of both silanol clusters and Brønsted acid sites, Pt single atoms are stabilized by weakening the -OH bond. In Sn-CHA, Pt atoms are stabilized by coordinating with the framework Sn in the absence of defects, whereas the defects stabilized Pt over framework Sn. Using insights from these DFT studies, we performed free energy ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the kinetic stability of these sites and understand the effect of entropy at 900K on the relative stability of several electronically comparable sites. Lastly, we evaluated the catalytic activity of these sites towards small alkane dehydrogenation on the most stable sites, guided by DFT and AIMD.Moliner, M.et al.,ACS Catalysis2018,8(10), 9520-9528.Xu, Z.et al.,ACS Catalysis2020,10(1), 818-828.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOptimising fixed bed chemical reactors requires a deep understanding of the interconnected nature of the bed structure with its heat and mass transfer profiles. For this, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models play a key role, especially when directly coupled with experimental setups. In our previous work, the internal structure of laboratory-scale catalytic beds, consisting of particles produced by sieving, was generated and analysed through computed tomography scans [1]. The beds consisted of a wide range of particle sizes, shapes, and orientations, creating a highly polydispersed structure, which was significantly different than that formed by monodispersed spheres [1]. By meshing and simulating the flow through a section of these beds, significant local velocity and pressure gradients between neighbouring pores were observed [2].Due to their complexity, a fundamental understanding of polydispersed beds has not been reached. This necessitates studies at the individual particle scale, focusing on particle shape and orientation. In the conference, catalytic particles of various shapes are placed at different orientations with regards to the incoming flow, Fig. 1, and the physicochemical phenomena around and within them are resolved. Orientation determined the exposed surface area of the particle, and how the flow is distributed around it. Specifically, convection’s impact was driven by the particle’s orientation, affecting the pressure and temperature profiles, and introducing significant local intraparticle temperature gradients which modified the reaction rate. Orientation also drove the intraparticle diffusion rate, either restricting or enhancing it, and thus the particle efficiency factor. These observations yield valuable insights into the association of particle form with the involved physicochemical phenomena, advancing reactor engineering.[1] S.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe direct reduction of esters using H2from biomass-derived esters offers a sustainable method to produce ethers. This chemistry occurs on homogeneous catalysts and costly metal hydrides and has not been reported in the heterogenous catalysis sector. We recently demonstrated that the direct hydrogenation of propyl acetate by H2can produce ethyl propyl ether with selectivities between 6-18% over heterogeneous catalysts, Pd nanoparticles supported on Nb2O5and WO3having Brønsted acid sites. More recently, metal identity studies over metal-incorporated FAU having Brønsted acidic sites (i.e., Pt-, Pd- and Ru-FAU) demonstrated that Pt-FAU results in much greater rates and ether selectivities (34%) among tested metals.In this contribution, we investigated zeolite framework effects on ether formation chemistry using Pt-based zeolites. We synthesized Pt-zeolite catalysts with varying pore diameters and channel dimensionality (Pt-CHA, Pt-BEA, Pt-MOR, Pt-FER, Pt-MFI, Pt-FAU). The ether formation rate over large pore Pt-zeolite (Pt-FAU) is an order of magnitude higher than another smaller pore Pt-zeolite (e.g., Pt-MFI, and -BEA). The heat of adsorption and activation energy explain the ether formation rate trend: dispersive interactions between the transition state with surrounding molecules (ester or ester-derived intermediate) within zeolite pore stabilize the transition state, thus ether formation rates are improved. Lower channel dimensionality increases the possibility that the reactant meets the metal site first to facilitate the ether formation pathway compared to acid-catalyzed side reactions because ether formation is a metal-acid reaction whereas side reactions (e.g., hydrolysis and transesterification) are acid-catalyzed reactions. Consequently, the lower channel dimensionality zeolites (e.g., Pt-FER) have high ether selectivity of up to 50%.Pt-based zeolite would be an attractive material for ether formation because it improves selectivities of up to 50% of the highest ether selectivity ever achieved in the flow reactor.

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study has proposed a new method for producing potassium sorbate (KS) from triacetic acid lactone (TAL), a biomass-derived chemical, which can be biologically synthesized from glucose. KS is widely used as a preservative in various foods, pharmaceuticals, and other industrial applications. This approach has a higher yield to KS from TAL than the previous method that produced sorbic acid from TAL. Sorbic acid used alone had limited value due to its low water solubility; use of water-soluble KS can overcome this problem. So far, KS has been manufactured by converting sorbic acid with potassium hydroxide. Therefore, we have proposed a new approach for producing KS rather than making sorbic acid as an intermediate. TAL-derived KS by hydrogenation, dehydration, and ring-opening & hydrolysis reactions. TAL can be fully hydrogenated over 10wt% Pd/Al2O3to give close to quantitative yields of HMP (95% yield). This study has carried out dehydration of 4-hyrdoxy-6-methyl 2H-Pyran-2-one (HMP) over solid catalysts, and then the obtained parasorbic acid (PSA) at the yield of 86% with respect to TAL. Moreover, we have developed a kinetic model for the dehydration of HMP to PSA. The obtained PSA was reacted with an equal molar amount of KOH. Here, KOH was used as a reactant of the ring-opening hydrolysis reaction. The overall yield of the TAL-derived KS was calculated to 72.1%. The KS molecule was analyzed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra. The difference in THF solubility between the KS product and impurities enabled us to purify the KS product by simply extracting with THF, and the purity of KS product was measured to be >95% by HPLC analysis and 1H NMR spectra. Furthermore, the synthesized KS has shown similar antifungal activity with commercial potassium sorbate.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNeo acids are highly branched carboxylic acids currently produced from fossil fuels. The high steric hindrance due to their structure imparts excellent thermal and hydrolytic stability, and resistance to chemicals and oxidative compounds. Depending on the chemistry applied to the carboxylic functional group, derivatives with diverse applications can be obtained. Neo acids are commercially manufactured from petroleum-derived olefins (isobutene and mixed nonenes) through the Koch synthesis, such as neopentanoic acid and neodecanoic acid (ExxonMobil) and versatic acid (Hexion). However, the process involves harsh reaction conditions, such as high temperatures and pressures and strong acids, and toxic substances, which cause environmental concerns. Additionally, multi-step purifications are needed to separate dimeric and trimeric isobutene by-products. Thus, there remains a need for sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives to produce neo acids from renewable resources, such as biomass. In this work, we produce renewable neo acids from lignocellulosic biomass-derived furan via C-C coupling through hydroxyalkylation/alkylation (HAA), followed by ring-opening of furans through hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Catalyst screening and multi-parameter optimization using machine learning optimize the yield and elucidate the correlation between variables and outcomes. We demonstrate selective furan ring-opening without affecting the carboxylic acid to make neo acids.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDesigning catalysts to produce biomass-derived products is vital to society’s transition away from fossil fuels. One intriguing target class of compounds is surfactants, including the recently discovered oleo-furan sulfonates (OFSs). OFSs are a bio-derived class of surfactants that are highly tunable compared to their conventional counterparts. Whereas synthesis methods to produce OFS have been identified, these tend to be costly. A potential low-cost synthesis route for OFSs is the aldol reaction and condensation between bio-derived furfural and linear ketones. A promising catalyst for aldol chemistry is aminosilica, which is highly active because of acid-base cooperativity. However, a key challenge for aldol chemistry is product selectivity, including both chemoselectivity (reaction vs. condensation product) and regioselectivity (linear vs. branched products). Here, aminosilica catalysts are tuned for OFS surfactant production to improve the selectivity for the linear condensation product.SBA-15 is post-synthetically grafted with a primary (1°) or secondary (2°) aminosilane. The catalysts are tested with a symmetric ketone (i.e., acetone) to study chemoselectivity and unsymmetric ketones (i.e., 2-butanone and 2-undecanone) to assess regioselectivity trends. We show that amine type impacts the activity and selectivity. For the reaction between furfural and acetone, the observed chemoselectivity for the condensation product is higher for 2° SBA-15 than 1° SBA-15. The regioselectivity of the catalysts for the reaction with butanone follows a similar trend. Counter to previous work, our kinetic results show that 1° SBA-15 exhibits higher activity for reactions involving unsymmetric ketones, which is unexpected and will be investigated further. Ongoing work will elucidate the regioselectivity for the reaction with 2-undecanone and investigate temperature effects. Future work will leverage solvation and surface environment effects to improve the selectivity. Overall, this work develops a novel synthesis method for OFSs and establishes reactivity trends for aldol chemistry with unsymmetric ketones.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBiorefinery effluent is an excellent potential supply of green hydrogen as the hydrocarbons within the effluent can be catalytically decomposed. However, the diversity of chemicals within the effluent causes intermolecular interactions that reduce the resulting catalytic performance from that predicted from studies on ideal, mono-component feedstocks. Experiments performed on binary mixtures of carboxylic acids (acetic (AA), propionic (PA), and glycolic acid (GA)) over Pt/C showed that, depending on the constituent compositions, one component’s catalytic conversion would be inhibited. Here, we seek to construct a nanoscale picture of the competitive adsorption and decomposition of carboxylic acids on a representative Pt catalyst surface (i.e. Pt(111)) using density functional theory andab initiomolecular dynamics (AIMD) to clarify the role of intermolecular interactions and chemical structure on the upgrading of carboxylic acid mixtures to green hydrogen (Figure 1). Acid coverage was varied from near zero to saturation, and the possible configurations at each coverage were sampled using AIMD simulations. The average adsorption energy for each acid becomes more negative as coverage increases, indicative of strongly attractive intermolecular interactions that come about due to hydrogen bonding between adjacent carboxylic acid functionalities. An examination of the most stable dimer configurations for all three acids shows a clear trend in the intermolecular interaction strength from AA < PA < GA, which offers insights into the competitive adsorption effects observed experimentally. Furthermore, the calculation of the interaction energies for both pure and mixed acid dimers shows that mixed dimers have weaker interactions compared to pure dimers. Overall, the most stable acid configurations are those that maximize hydrogen bonding. Because the low-coverage results are unable to account for experimental findings that the coverage-dependent model adequately supports, this work demonstrates the importance of accounting for intermolecular interactions when studying reactions in mixed feedstock streams.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDirect acylation of furanics with carboxylic acids over Bronsted acid zeolites is an important reaction for the production of fuels and high-value chemicals.1-2However, furanics, which can serve as acyl acceptors, rapidly undergo coupling reactions in the presence of Bronsted acid surface sites leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. Carboxylic acids themselves can also form reactive ketenes in equilibrium with surface acyl species. In this work, the role of 2-methylfuran self-coupling, side reactions with ketenes, and sequential reactions with formed products are decoupled by feeding each species independently and comparing activity loss rates with those of varying surface coverage. The specific reactants employed in this study are 2-methylfuran (2-MF) and acetic acid (AA) to yield the product was 2-acetyl-5-methylfuran (Ac-MF). We reveal that the deactivation constant associated with direct 2-MF adsorption on a clean catalyst surface is approximately twice that of product self-coupling under identical conditions. Co-feeding carboxylic acids improves catalyst stability by diminishing the deactivation rate by several orders of magnitude via inhibiting adsorption of 2-MF and the formed products. Furthermore, evaluating the prominent route toward catalyst deactivation at high acid coverage was determined by systematic modification of surface coverage and the diffusion path of produced products. These results uncover the critical role of acetic acid to limit direct interaction between highly reactive acyl acceptors with surface Bronsted sites. Moreover, the addition of varying partial pressures of inert molecules with significant adsorption constants allows manipulation of surface coverage while maintaining the gas phase chemical potential. These experiments show that the product (Ac-MF) reacting with gas phase 2-MF is the primary mechanism of deactivation at high acid coverage, not sequential reactions along the diffusion path or direct interaction of 2MF with the zeolite surface.1)Science advances,2(9), e1601072.2)Journal of Catalysis,406, 48-55.",

In this study, chromium salt and the ionic liquids including [MIM(CH2)4HSO3]+X-, and [MIM]X-(where MIM represents methylimidazolium and X represents HSO4-, Cl-, Br-, or I-) were utilized to develop and optimize a suitable dual-catalyst system for the 5-HMF production with high selectivity. In addition, we investigated the use of several metal chlorides to improve the catalytic efficiency of the ionic liquid-catalyst-glucose conversion systems. The dual catalyst with the highest catalytic activity, CrCl2-[MIM]HSO4, selectively converted glucose to 5-HMF in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 140 °C. The use of DMSO with high polarity as an organic solvent was chosen since it facilitates solvation with the substrate, enhancing the 5-HMF productivity while lowering costs via reducing the amount of use of ionic liquid. Catalytic activity experiments demonstrate that the structure and properties of the ionic liquids significantly impact the glucose conversion and selectivity of the 5-HMF. This research provides an approach for developing a dual-catalyst system capable of selectively synthesizing 5-HMF from glucose.",

A more appealing and value-added use of lignin is as a precursor for the production of aromatic chemicals. The depolymerization of lignin selectively into its monomers can be achieved by the appropriate combinations of solvent, catalyst, and reaction conditions. However, due to the considerable complexity and natural variation in the molecular structure of lignin, mechanistic studies of catalytic lignin depolymerization are challenging. Beyond that, lignin depolymerization usually (1) requires relatively high temperature (above 200 °C) and pressure (above 80 bar); (2) involves co-existence of solid, liquid and gas phases; and (3) differs from typical catalytic reactions due to the macromolecular nature of the substrate. In this study, we have applied Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) on lignin samples to probe their polymer coil size and conformational changes that occur at reaction conditions and upon interaction with copper-doped porous metal oxide catalyst. This project leverages the unique high-temperature and –pressure neutron cell technology at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).In-situSANS studies will provide a means to probe changes in the structure of lignin as a function reaction conditions (i.e., time, temperature, and the presence of catalyst) while eliminating any potential structural artifacts that would be caused by the reactor quenching and/or sample preparation occurring in ex-situ experiments.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbonyl group hydrogenation over metal catalysts has been a classical reaction for trying to understand solvation effects in catalysis. Experimentally, it is well-established that in the vapor phase, Pt and Pd are much better hydrogenation catalysts than Ru. However, in liquid water, Ru is usually more active than Pt and Pd. Along these lines, Demir et al. showed that already water vapor inhibits the rate of the carbonyl group hydrogenation in acetone over Pt while it enhances the rate over Ru.1Recently, Zhao et al. claimed that for furfural hydrogenation over Pd catalysts in liquid water, proton-coupled electron transfer steps accelerate the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group.2This claim has been questioned by Yu et al., who showed quite convincingly that liquid water does not act as a co-catalyst in the rate-controlling step of this reaction.3To obtain a deeper understanding of carbonyl group hydrogenation over transition metal catalysts in water, we studied the 2-butanone hydrogenation over transition metal catalysts with our explicit solvation method for metal surfaces (eSMS). In these studies, liquid water was both a co-catalyst and a solvent. Without considering water as a co-catalyst, computational studies cannot explain the experimental observation of an acceleration of the carbonyl group hydrogenation over Ru catalysts. The main difference between Ru and other group VIII transition metals is a difference in the rate controlling step. Over Ru, hydrogenation of the carbonyl oxygen atom is rate controlling while it is the hydrogenation of the carbonyl carbon atom over most transition metals. Interestingly, we observe a strong solvent stabilization by water acting as a co-catalyst only for the hydrogenation at the O-atom, explaining experimental observations.J Catal2021,403, 215-227.Nat Commun2022,13(1), 7154.Nat Catal2019,2(5), 431-436.",

Due to the broad range of potential lignin-intermediates, it is, therefore, critical to develop a process to study the various alkyl chain and functionality in these lignin-derived intermediates. While selective hydrogenation of phenolic compounds has been widely studied, achieving high selectivity towards the desired product while maintaining high reaction activity remains a common challenge.In this work, we demonstrated the ability to achieve high selectivity (>90%) towards various alkyl-substituted cyclohexanone via liquid phase hydrogenation in an up-flow solid-liquid-gas phase reactor using a Pd/Al2O3catalyst. The reaction performance was quantified through conversion and selectivity studies using hydrogenation of phenol, p-cresol, and p-propyl-phenol in the flow reactor system under various space velocities and hydrogen partial pressure. In addition, kinetic measurements and a stability study over time is presented as a function of the variation of alkyl groups, metal dispersion, and operating parameters. The results from this study provide new evidence for the ability to process complex lignin-derived materials under mild conditions into valuable feedstocks for high-performing polymers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNon-covalent interactions of organic solvents and their mixtures in water are observed to affect the rates of acid catalysed reactions of biomass-derived platform chemicals. Because of the differential stabilization of acidic protons in different solvents, mixtures of organic solvents with water are proposed, wherein on increasing the fraction of the organic phase, the aqueous phase is observed to preferentially cluster around the reactant with increased hydrogen bonding interactions. Moreover, acid catalysed reactions conducted in zeolites, also show an additional positive confinement effect, for which the stabilization of the transition state by the zeolite pores, leads to a lowering of activation energy. Our group has carried out simulations in explicit solvent environments using Car–Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations and compare the two implicit and explicit solvation model to explain the reactivity of biomass-derived platform lactones in water and tetrahydrofuran (THF).In this study, effect of organic solvents and their mixtures with water on the dehydration reaction of Mevalonolactone (MVL) are elucidated using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)-metadynamics simulations. The activation free energy barrier for the dehydration of MVL is observed to be higher by around 45 kJ/mol in water as compared to THF due to possible changes in the rate determining step; C-H bond activation in water as compared to C-O bond activation in THF. In mixtures of water and THF, the presence of organic phase is observed to facilitate a water enriched confined space around the reactant, which helps in reducing the activation barrier, compared to pure water and THF. While in the confined pores of zeolite, water molecules are observed to facilitate the abstraction of the proton from the zeolite framework, forming a hydronium ion cluster inside the pore. The nature and size of the hydronium ion formed has consequential significance on reaction kinetics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractModeling the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of aromatics under realistic conditions is essential as this influences both the catalyst activity and the kinetic mechanisms under which we can produce usable biofuels. Within these systems, there are two dominant interactions that must be captured to ensure for an accurate representation of the system: (1) the surface-mediated interactions resulting from the electronic exchanges between the catalyst and adsorbents, and (2) the through-space-steric interactions between co-adsorbed species. The strength of the latter is highly dependent on the adsorbing species’ configuration and coverage and is influenced by the presence of a solvent environment—a significant note since water is a byproduct of catalytic HDO.This investigation uses first principles to model the coverage-dependent adsorption energies for a range of aromatics with increasingly complex functional groups on Pd(111) (Figure 1). For most adsorbates tested, the data fits the linear mean-field (MF) model well, where the only adsorbates with Root-Mean-Square-Errors(RMSE) larger than 50 meV are aromatics with carboxylic acids, suggesting that the MF approach does not work for those aromatics. Close-shelled adsorbates all have repulsive interactions, demonstrated by their large, linear MF slopes, whereas open-shelled aromatics (phenoxy, guaioxy) have near-zero slopes, indicating that their energies have a minimal dependence on changing coverage.We also found that the inclusion of a water environment indicates an increase in the lateral interactions within these systems. This has a larger effect on the adsorption energies of the phenolics at lower coverages compared to near-saturation coverages (Figure 2).From this data, the lateral interactions can be quantified and a parity plot predicting the coverage-dependent adsorption energies can be created, allowing us to both describe and predict the energies of phenolics on selective transition state metals. This all aids in the accurate representation of the behavior of HDO mechanisms to produce renewable biofuel.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCatalytic hydrogenation (HYD) of lignin-derived aromatics is of high interest for the sustainable production of commodity chemicals and various polymer building blocks. Several noble and non-noble transition metal catalysts with various solvents have been investigated. However, conventional HYD of lignin-derived monomers requires high H2pressures and temperatures, and yet, achieving the desired conversion and selectivity remains a challenge. Herein, a novel reaction system with Ruthenium (Ru) as a catalyst and water as a solvent is developed for the selective HYD of phenol, guaiacol, and other oxygenated aromatic compounds to corresponding ring-saturated products under ambient conditions (room temperature, and 1 bar H2pressure). Using a synergistic combination of quantum mechanical DFT simulations, catalysis experiments, and advanced characterization techniques (XRD, SEM, XPS, TEM, and isotope labeling experiments), we elucidate the condensed phase catalytic reaction mechanism. Interestingly, the Ru catalyst favours selective C – O bond dissociation (DDO) in the gas phase for the aforementioned aromatic reactants; however, it switches its selectivity to HYD in the presence of water. Mechanistic DFT simulations reveal that water partially dissociates and absorbs on the catalyst surface as a combination of hydroxyl fragments, H atoms, and intact water molecules, and that this is critical for Ru to flip its selectivity from DDO to HYD in the aqueous phase. Experimental results demonstrate a high selectivity (> 99%) and >90 % conversion towards the fully hydrogenated products in the presence of water, corroborating the computational results. Up to date, no other solvent has been shown to act as a hydrogen donor for the selective HYD of lignin derived aromatics, thus requiring high H2pressures and temperatures. Our results conclusively show that water, as a solvent, provides excellent HYD conversion/selectivity at ambient conditions, thereby eliminating the need for energy intensive H2pressures and temperatures.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe direct reduction of O2to H2O2, which involves the transfer of two protons and two electrons, is a highly desirable transformation over traditional chemical transformations for H2O2synthesis. We have shown recently that the reduction of O2with H2on Pd-based catalysts is co-catalyzed by surface redox mediators. Hydroxymethyl surface intermediates form in methanol solvents and act as redox mediators that enhance reactivity and selectivity towards H2O2production. Herein, we explore a family of quinone substrates, including 1,4-benzoquinone, and their influence on O2reduction to H2O2. Ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations are employed to elucidate the reaction environments and understand the experimentally observed activity and selectivity trends. In conjunction with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation measurements, first-principles calculations show that these quinone substrates adsorb strongly on the Pd surface. These surface-bound quinones then sequentially catalyze H2oxidation and O2reduction via. proton-coupled electron transfer steps by forming hydroxyquinone intermediates as mediators. H2oxidation results in the formation of protons and electrons, which hydrogenate the carbonyl bond of the quinone to generate the hydroxyquinone mediator. The bound-hydroxyquinone intermediate mediates the subsequent proton and electron transfer to the adsorbed molecular oxygen to form the *OOH intermediate and regenerate the quinone species. The two-proton and two-electron steps leading to either H2O2or water formation are investigated. The results show a higher intrinsic barrier for water formation due to the penalty involved in O-O bond cleavage. The electrophilicity of these surface-bound species influences the selectivity towards H2O2production by selectively manipulating the surface electron density. The insights from this work can be further extended to develop improved transformation involving novel pathways with redox-active mediators for the selective production of H2O2.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPd speciation is essential to the investigation of Pd-based zeolite catalysts for both passive NOxadsorption (PNA) and methane (CH4) oxidation applications with ionic Pd and PdO as the active sites, respectively [1]. Herein, the effect of H2O exposure on Pd speciation is investigated at ambient temperature (25oC) and moisture (3.1% H2O) over Pd (0.5 wt.%) supported on small (CHA, 3.8Å), medium (MFI, 5-6Å), and large (BEA, 6-9Å) pore zeolites. 100 mg (250-500 µm) of catalyst was loaded in a packed bed micro-reactor (200 Lg-1h-1) and ionic Pd formation was promoted through a pretreatment at 750°C/1 h (20% O2/Ar) [2]. The catalysts were then treated with 3.1% H2Oand 20% O2/Ar at 25oC/4 h to investigate the speciation of Pd after H2O exposure. CH4oxidation (1500 ppm CH4, 12% O2/Ar, 100 - 600oC (5oC/min)) and PNA (100 ppm NO, 12% O2/Ar, 30 min adsorption at 100oC and desorption from 100-600oC (20oC/min)) were used as probe reactions for titrating PdO and ionic Pd, respectively, before and after exposure to H2O. The CH4oxidation performance of all studied Pd/zeolite catalysts improved after H2O exposure compared to the fresh catalyst performance. Specifically, the CH4oxidation performance at 600oC improved by 85, 15, and 18% over Pd(0.5)/BEA, Pd(0.5)/MFI, and Pd/(0.5)/CHA, respectively, after H2O exposure (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the NOx:Pd ratio and thus, the NOx adsorption capacity, decreased by 94% and 32% after H2O exposure over Pd(0.5)/BEA (Fig. 1B) and Pd/(0.5)/CHA, respectively, indicating a decrease in ionic Pd. The decrease in ionic Pd species resulted in PdO formation (CO-DRIFTS and H2-TPR) through solvation of ionic Pd and aggregation to form PdO after oxidative dehydration. This work illustrates that Pd speciation should be taken into consideration when Pd/zeolite catalysts are pre-exposure to H2O under ambient conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPotassium-promoted, silica-supported PdAu is catalytically active for the gas-phase acetoxylation of ethylene with acetic acid to form vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). Potassium, which is incorporated into the catalyst via wet impregnation of its salt solution, is known to improve long-term activity and selectivity for VAM. This common catalyst preparation step is generally assumed to have no effect on catalyst structure. However, in this work, we report evidence to the contrary. We initially synthesized a silica-supported PdAu (PdAu/SiO2, 8 wt% Pd, 4 wt% Au) model catalyst containing Pd-rich PdAu alloy and pure Au phases. A Design of Experiments (DOE) approach was implemented to impregnate the as-synthesized PdAu/SiO2catalyst with varying loadings of potassium acetate (0, 5, and 10 wt% K) using wet impregnation solutions with varying concentrations of acetic acid (0, 50, and 100 vol% AcOH in water). Samples were then characterized to detect changes in metal nanoparticle structure (XRD, XPS, and XAS) and surface species formation (DRIFTS). Impregnation with KOAc aqueous solution revealed no XRD-detectible changes to the bimetal structure, whereas DRIFTS indicated the presence of Pd3(OAc)6species, which led to up to 2% Pd loss after washing with water. Carrying out the impregnation step with an AcOH-only solution caused significant enlargement of the pure Au grain size and generated a smaller amount of Pd3(OAc)6. During co-impregnation of AcOH and KOAc, grain sizes were enlarged slightly, and substantial amounts of K2Pd2(OAc)6and Pd3(OAc)6were detected by DRIFTS and correlated to up to 32% Pd loss after washing. Multivariate analysis confirmed the individual effects from KOAc and AcOH as well as their interactions were statistically significant. Ultimately, these results indicate metal leaching and restructuring can occur during the wet impregnation process, suggesting care should be taken during this common catalyst preparation procedure.",

Propylene is mainly harvested as by-product from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking but direct dehydrogenation of propane has been proposed to be a viable route for propylene production. The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane generally carries out on Al2O3-supported Pt/Sn catalyst, which has shown promising reactivity and selectivity. Herein, we use DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling to assess how different surface structures and co-adsorbed Al2O3affect the selectivity towards propylene of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on Pt. We study PDH on different Pt facets including flat surfaces (Pt(100), Pt(111)) and stepped surfaces(Pt(211), Pt(511)) to see how reactivity and selectivity towards propylene change with surface arrangement, and find that Pt(100) poses highest reactivity while Pt(211) shows highest selectivity to propylene. Additionally, we find that on step and kink surfaces (Pt(211), Pt(321), Pt(533)), Al2O3precursors form a one-dimensional ribbon type of structure, leaving open active sites on the upper terraces where PDH reaction intermediates can interact with both Pt surface atoms and the Al2O3-precursor; hence, postulates effects on the reactivity and selectivity of PDH. Our microkinetic model with modification from experimental finding show improved in selectivity towards propylene and reduction of coke formation on Pt surfaces in the presence of the alumina ALD.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol using green hydrogen produced from renewable energy is a potential process to achieve carbon reduction. Cu-based catalysts are of great interest due to their availability and high efficiency in hydrogenation reactions. For the rational design of Cu-based catalysts to further improve the reaction activity and space-time yield of methanol, it has been revealed that highly dispersed Cu particles, abundant oxygen vacancies, and reasonable surface Cu+content are crucial for activating reactants and stabilizing reaction intermediates. This study focuses on the development of a selective exsolution method using CuAl2O4spinel as precursor to regulate the dispersion and electronic structure of Cu species to obtain efficient Cu-based catalysts for CO2hydrogenation to methanol. After a suitable reduction treatment, the CuAl2O4catalyst shows enhanced CO2conversion, better methanol selectivity, and 5.7 times higher methanol yield compared to the supported Cu/Al2O3catalyst under the conditions of 240 °C and 3 MPa. Thein-situcharacterization of the exsolution process of CuAl2O4demonstrates that highly dispersed Cu particles with an average particle size of 10 nm are formed. In contrast to the Cu/Al2O3catalysts, abundant Cu+species and oxygen vacancies are formed on the surface of CuAl2O4due to the stronger metal-support interaction. It is expected to further improve the catalytic performance of Cu-based catalysts for CO2hydrogenation to methanol by adding various metal oxides (i.e., ZnO or ZrO2) on the CuAl2O4precursor and applying this exsolution strategy to construct copper-oxide interfacial sites while increasing the content of Cu+species on the catalyst surface.",

Manufacturing of nylon and esters require cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol as starting materials. These are also used as solvents in several processes. While conventional methods rely on fossil-derived crude oil to produce these chemicals, we are focusing on the production of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol using bio-derived feedstock. We have developed palladium (Pd) catalysts using an organic-inorganic hybrid (OIH) silica support for aqueous phase hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. The organosilica support is synthesized using sol-gel method from an organometallic precursor, bis (trimethoxy)silyl ethylbenzene. Surface hydroxyl groups were capped using hexamethyl disilazane to modify surface polarity, hydrophilicity and textural properties. Palladium supported on scaffolds of different polarity showed significantly different catalytic activity and selectivity during aqueous phase phenol hydrogenation performed in batch reactor at 50 bar H2and 200 °C. SBA-15 supported catalyst was used for comparison due to its similar textural properties and hydrophilic nature. In acetone and water vapor adsorption experiments, the organosilica support with capped surface hydroxyl groups adsorbed 31 times more acetone than water while SBA-15 absorbed 1.7 times more water than acetone. This confirmed that organically modified silica support had higher affinity towards organics and was more hydrophobic in comparison with SBA-15. Rate constant for phenol vapor adsorption increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the support. Temperature programmed phenol desorption using DRIFTS suggested stronger phenol adsorption on organosilica supports as compared to SBA-15. Pd catalysts and the supports were further characterized by N2physisorption, Infrared Spectroscopy, Si NMR, pulse CO chemisorption, transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and liquid adsorption experiments. Thus, in this work we report a unique and facile approach of synthesizing a catalyst with tunable polarity/hydrophilicity and hence tunable aqueous phase phenol hydrogenation activity.",

The utilization of hydrogen as a fuel for fuel cell devices is well known, however, challenges associated with the use of gaseous, reactive fuels has driven the search for alternative solid and liquid fuels that can be coupled to a fuel cell architecture. Hypophosphite salts have recently gained attention as a promising solid fuel for sustainable fuel cells due to its ease of handling, stable storage characteristics, and extremely negative reduction potential. Further, these hypophosphite salts can be used to efficiently generate palladium hydride (Pd-H), which has attracted considerable basic science and applied research interest as a catalyst in a variety of reactions.Herein, we have studied a hypophosphite fuel coupled to palladium catalysts to understand the mutual relationship between hypophosphite concentration, Pd-H structure and electrochemical performance. Our results indicate that hypophosphite can produce significantly negative voltages relative to reversible hydrogen electrode(RHE) on palladium electrodes, with the open-circuit voltage(Voc) dependent on the hypophosphite concentration. These observed Voc values are equivalent to extremely high hydrogen headspace pressures (>200 bar) in the absence of hypophosphite. We further found that a decrease in the palladium particle size corresponds to a more negative open-circuit voltage. Specifically, our experiments yielded Voc of -0.35 V vs. RHE and -0.14 V vs. RHE with Pd nanoparticulates and bulk Pd disks, respectively. Lastly, we compared the ability of the palladium hydride synthesized using hypophosphite and its electrochemical counterparts to generate hydrogen. Our study provides a framework for understanding the potential of hypophosphite as a sustainable fuel for fuel cells, and lays the foundation for further research in both alternative fuel cell fuels and Pd-H catalysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe continued rise in global energy consumption, along with the associated environmental hazards, pose a significant risk to our society’s infrastructure unless the main source is changed. Electrocatalysis involving hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), provide a pathway for energy storage and conversion due to their enhanced environmental friendliness and efficient energy input compared to their thermocatalytic counterparts. Currently, the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts suffer from scarcity and high cost. MXenes, a novel family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbide and nitride materials, show potential as cost-efficient and highly abundant electrocatalysts with limited knowledge on their electrocatalytic mechanisms. This is especially true when considering the often-overlooked nitride family of MXenes. Herein, we investigate the electrocatalytic performance of a Ti2N nitride MXene under different electrolytic environment. The effect of surface phenomena is investigated through manipulation of the surface passivation layer, as evidenced by Raman and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Successful decoupling of the bulk and surface phenomena is achieved through Raman laser power attenuation. Under acidic medium, the surface reactivity towards HER is poor but the bulk reactivity for NRR is favored, making it an optimal NRR catalyst. Under alkaline medium, the surface reactivity of the pristine Ti2N MXene for ORR is high, but also leads to surface passivation and thus hinders the long-term electrocatalytic activity. Overall, these results provide fundamental insights into future optimization strategies of the Ti2N nitride MXene, along with other electrocatalysts, towards electrocatalytic applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNH3emissions are predominantly caused by denitrification units of coal-fired power plants and diesel engine vehicles. To meet stringent nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission regulations from diesel engine vehicles, NH3is introduced into the aftertreatment systems containing selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units, with downstream ammonia slip catalysts (ASC) responsible for removing residual NH3from the exhaust stream. ASCs are dual-layer materials consisting of a top-layer NOxSCR catalyst (e.g., Cu-CHA) and a bottom-layer NH3oxidation catalyst comprising platinum supported on gamma alumina (Pt/γ-Al2O3). During operation, ASCs experience varying operating conditions that influence Pt oxidation state, surface coverage, and structure, arising in differences in observed NH3oxidation kinetics and selectivities. When heating or cooling the ASC under NH3oxidation reaction conditions, rates differ during ignition and extinction cycles resulting in a hysteresis phenomenon, with higher NH3oxidation rates observed for the extinction branch. Such hysteresis phenomena have been observed for other oxidation reactions (e.g., CO, CH4,and NO oxidation) over Pt/γ-Al2O3; however, the mechanistic origins and structural changes underlying this behavior remains debated. Here, we combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements with theoretical calculations to elucidate the kinetic and mechanistic details of NH3oxidation on model Pt/γ-Al2O3powder samples of different Pt particle size and pretreatment history. A suite of characterization techniques including H2temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) andspectroscopic techniques (in situX-ray absorption andex situXPS) were used to determine the Pt oxidation state and structure across a range of reaction-relevant conditions. The understanding of the kinetic, mechanistic, and structural factors that give rise to a hysteresis in oxidation behavior from these techniques can provide guidance on how to design and operate robust ASC catalysts in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCatalytic ammonia (NH3) oxidation has been applied in the Ostwald process to produce Nitric Oxide (NO) and in ammonia slip control to produce nitrogen (N2). Nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas, is an undesired product in both of these applications. Platinum has been shown to be an effective catalyst for this reaction. Previous computational studies have shown activity and selectivity of Pt-100, Pt-111 and Pt edge sites as a function of temperature. They also show that these surfaces can be covered with different amounts of O and NO at different temperatures. As these adsorbates bind strongly with the Pt surface, they have an effect on its surface energy. In this work, we quantify the effect of O and NO on the surface energy of Pt-100 and Pt-111 using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. We use Wulff construction to calculate change in distribution of Pt-111, Pt-100 and edge sites on a Pt nanoparticle in presence of O and NO under different reaction conditions. We find that Pt-100 sites are more abundant in the conditions that favor high NO coverage and this effect is more significant on smaller nanoparticles. Finally, we use a mixed site microkinetic model to calculate expected activity and selectivity for Pt nanoparticles of different sizes and show how they explain experimental observations of the same quantities on different particle sizes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn stoichiometric gasoline engines, three-way catalysts (TWCs) are used to curb tailpipe emissions of unburned hydrocarbons, CO, NOx and other pollutants. Due to the high price and low abundance of precious metals used in TWC formulations, there has been significant research exploring improving precious metal utilization through new formulations and enhanced synthesis methods. Kinetic studies can then be performed to assess the CO and C3H6oxidation activity of these newly synthesized TWCs, and a combination of chemisorption and spectroscopic techniques would normally be used to determine the number of exposed metal sites and, therefore, reaction rates.Newly synthesized TWCs may contain various promoters that could potentially interfere with the particle size calculation (i.e., carbonate formation on the catalyst surface during CO adsorption, O spillover from the support to the metal site), chemisorption protocols must be modified to alleviate these issues. Literature results have shown that by pre-exposing the catalyst surface with CO2, the overestimation of particle size calculation during CO adsorption on CeO2-containing catalysts was corrected, and a more accurate particle size was obtained [1]. Inspired by these results, we adapted a CO chemisorption protocol to include a CO2pre-adsorption phase before CO adsorption. The lack of carbonate formation on the supports after CO chemisorption was verified using DRIFTS. This technique was applied to a series of Pd-based catalysts with different loading, aged at different temperatures and on different supports. CO oxidation kinetics were also performed to confirm that the particle sizes measured coincide with the structure insensitivity of CO oxidation.References[1] Takeguchi, T., Manabe, S., Kikuchi, R., Eguchi, K., Kanazawa, T., Matsumoto, S., & Ueda, W.

    "abstract": "AbstractMethane (CH4) emissions from natural gas-powered automobiles have become an immediate environmental concern. CH4has a ⁓25-fold greater global warming potential than CO2and thus possesses a substantial environmental impact. Complete CH4oxidation can reduce emissions and Pd-based catalysts have a promising CH4oxidation activity [1]. Pd/zeolite catalysts with high Si/Al molar ratios are more hydrophobic, compared to lower Si/Al molar ratio zeolites, and have an improved CH4oxidation activity. Pd/SSZ-13 catalysts with low Si/Al molar ratios have shown a promising CH4oxidation activity, but Pd/SSZ-13 catalysts (Si/Al >100) are under investigated. Herein, 2 wt.% Pd/SSZ-13(156) was washcoated (1.1 gwashcoat/in3) on cordierite minicores and its CH4oxidation performance was evaluated under rich, moderate lean, and lean conditions under realistic conditions (Table 1). The Pd/SSZ-13(156) minicores were pretreated (20% O­2/Ar at 500oC/20 min) and evaluated under rich, moderate lean, and lean conditions as single successive CH4oxidation cycles (200-650oC (5oC/min)). The results showed that the temperature that 90% CH4conversion was achieved was the lowest (353oC) under moderate lean conditions compared to rich (384oC) and lean (357oC) conditions over Pd/SSZ-13(156) minicores (Fig. 1). The effect of hydrothermal aging (HTA) and SO2poisoning on the CH4oxidation performance of Pd/SSZ-13(156) minicores is reported here for the first-time with T90's decreasing from lean (401oC) to rich (396oC) to moderate lean (376oC). The majority of the deactivation was observed after HTA with a greater increase in the average T90of 26oC compared to SO2poisoning (1oC) over all conditions. The decrease in performance after HTA can be attributed to Pd sintering. Nevertheless, Pd/SSZ-13(156) exhibits excellent CH4oxidation performance with maximum T90observed under all studied conditions ≤401oC after HTA and SO2poisoning, demonstrating hydrothermal stability and resistance to SO2poisoning for the abatement of CH4.",

Pd-containing high-silica zeolites, such as Pd/SSZ-13 (CHA), outperform Pd/Al2O3for complete CH4oxidation in the presence of H2O and remain hydrothermally stable due to their hydrophobicity and superior durability.2CHA zeolites (Si/Al = 15-137) were synthesized in both hydroxide (OH) and fluoride (F) media,3ion-exchanged to 1 wt.% Pd, and then evaluated for CH4oxidation activity before and after simulated aging for 1 h at 650 ºC under wet-lean conditions (0.15% CH4, 5% O2, 5% H2O, bal. Ar). A comparison of temperatures required to achieve 50% and 90% CH4conversion (i.e., T50, T90) revealed that Pd/CHA (Si/Al > 33) demonstrates improved light-off activity and stability under dry and wet conditions compared to Pd/Al2O3. Decreasing T50and T90temperatures for Pd/CHA with increasing Si/Al molar ratios and results for Pd/CHA‑OH (137) and Pd/CHA-F (80) of similar Si/Al ratio suggest that more hydrophobic zeolites improve low temperature performance and hydrothermal stability. Steady state CH4oxidation rates measured on 1 wt.% Pd/CHA-F-80 at 250 ºC (0.15 % CH4, 5% O2, N2bal.) were ~3.5 × 10-7moles CH4(gcat)-1s-1, or ~2× greater than Pd/Al2O3under similar conditions (Figure 1). Higher CH4oxidation rates, higher apparent CH4orders (~1), and lower activation barriers for Pd/CHA-F (Si/Al > 33) suggest that the nature of the active Pd is different on these hydrophobic zeolites with sites that can more easily activate CH4compared to Pd/Al2O3.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe performance of a three-way catalyst (TWC) in natural gas-powered vehicles is enhanced by periodic changes in air-to-fuel ratio (λ-modulation). The reaction networks and sequences inside the catalyst that facilitate such enhanced performance have not been extensively investigated. This work applied intra-catalyst measurements (SpaciMS) to analyze the transient spatiotemporal gas concentrations inside a Pd-based TWC to establish relationships between CH4, NOx, CO and H2conversion pathways. Steam reforming and partial oxidation were revealed to be the main CH4conversion routes. The cyclic rich-lean conditions combined with the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of the TWC generate reduced and oxidized zones that are constantly moving within the catalyst, changing the dominant chemical reactions occurring on the surface. In the reduced zones, OSC is depleted while CH4is converted through steam reforming and NOx is converted through reactions with H2, CO, and other surface-bound reducing fragments formed by CH4conversion. In the oxidized zones, OSC is replenished, CH4is converted by partial oxidation, and H2, CO, and NH­3are oxidized. The length of lean-rich phases impacts the catalyst performance significantly; too short or too long of a rich or lean phase can lower the overall conversion of reactive species. An inhibition of CH4conversion was observed during the rich phase possibly due to CO-poisoning of active sites. The intra-catalyst measurements revealed that the catalyst consists of three distinct reaction zones and their lengths vary with modulation conditions. Various modulation frequencies, amplitudes, λ-centers, and temperatures were investigated which allowed an understanding of how these parameters affect the reaction zones and catalyst utilization. Understandings from this work can enable adaptive λ-control strategies to optimize the overall TWC performance over a range of vehicle operating conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCu-SSZ-13 has been widely used as a commercial catalyst for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOxin diesel engine exhaust systems. In real world applications, the deactivation of Cu-CHA via chemical poisoning derived from different exhaust gas components, originating from biodiesel and engine oils for example, can be a durability issue for SCR catalysts, with literature showing that the accumulation of engine oil elements influences the catalyst’s physiochemical properties and can cause deactivation. Most of these studies introduce the poisoning element through an impregnation method. A focus of this work is to mimic real-world applications more closely by introducing the engine oil directly on the Cu-CHA zeolite and studying the impact of chemical species associated with engine oil on the performance of Cu-CHA.In this study, real and surrogate engine oils were deposited on a commercial Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst using a simple dip method. For comparative study, the impact of the base oil with a surrogate with higher concentrations of additives was also studied. Results will be shown that describe the accumulation of different elements and their impact on activity. Those impacts will also be defined through different characterization studies, which reflect the change in physiochemical properties after oil exposure. Some oils were formulated with only one element to better decouple the effect of individual elements. High temperature experiments were run to evaluate if the catalysts could be regenerated after the oil exposures, and further confirmed that the accumulation of engine oil elements through multiple exposures could generate a stable species (metal oxides/ash/deposits) that causes irreversible poisoning.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPlatinum-based catalysts are widely used for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) in fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and electrolyzers due to their excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability. However, platinum's high cost and scarcity has led to extensive research efforts in alloying platinum with other transition metals, modifying its surface properties, and utilizing its nanostructures. Experimentally synthesizable, rationally designed supported metal films on various earth-abundant carbides and nitrides may also have the potential to attain the theoretical maximum for ORR and achieve high activity and stability with low Pt usage.In this study, we selected nonmagnetic 2D and 3D metal carbides and nitrides (TiC, TiN, VC, VN, CrN, NiC, NiN, MoC, MoN, and WC) with their (111) facets exposed, and adsorbed mono- and bilayers of Pt, Ag, and Au epitaxially and non-epitaxially. We assessed the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of the films and evaluated their ORR catalytic activity using the computational hydrogen electrode framework by explicitly calculating the limiting potentials. The OOH* vs OH* scaling relation deviates from the bond order conservation slope of 1 (seen across unsupported metals, alloys, and single-atom catalysts). This deviation in slope results in the ORR volcano peak shifting upward by 0.15 V, relative to the unsupported metal catalysts. This is because the metal film's reactivity is modulated by electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) as well as strain. We identify at least 10 heterostructures with higher limiting potentials than Pt (111), including Pt/CrC with the highest at 0.93 V. We perform a detailed electronic analysis on these heterostructures to predict the key features contributing to the increased activity. Tuning the reactivity of the metal film via its interaction with the underlying support opens a wide material space for the design of high-performance ORR catalysts with reduced precious metal loading.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes and ketones is a critical reaction in the synthesis of fine chemicals and has been intensely studied over the past two decades. Few efforts, however, have examined the selective oxidative competition between different primary alcohols when two or more substrates are oxidized simultaneously. The present work specifically examines the competing selectivity between 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (MBA) and 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA) towards oxidation to their corresponding aldehydes using electrochemical methods. The MBA:NBA selectivity at the Pt anode was found to be 1:1 but significantly improved to 19:1 when reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) was used as the anode.Potential-dependent AIMD and DFT simulations with explicit solvents were carried out to examine the complex solid-liquid interface and elucidate the mechanistic features that control observed selectivity differences. Our results indicate the different selectivity originates from the changes in the adsorption energies on different electrode surfaces as well as the changes in intrinsic oxidation barriers. The Pt electrode strongly bind benzyl alcohols and induce significant structural changes in adsorbed aromatic, forming covalent Pt-C and Pt-O bonds between the Pt surface and alkoxy intermediates. The difference in the apparent activation barrier between the MBA and NBA is in the range of -5 to +3 kJ/mol, thus leading to the 1:1 selectivity. On the contrary, benzyl alcohols bind weakly to the RVC electrode surface via π−π interactions. This preserves the molecular structures and the electronic difference between two substrates induced by the electron-donating MeO and electron-withdrawing NO2substituents. The substituent effect has little influence on intrinsic reaction barriers but show significant differences in the adsorption energies (~30 kJ/mol) induced by the positively charged anode, resulting in the 19:1 selectivity. Mechanistic findings in this work can provide fundamental insights into electrochemical reactions that occur at metal and carbon electrode surfaces.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrocatalysis enables chemical transformations to be directly driven by renewable electricity, providing a viable route toward the decarbonization of the chemical industry. The implementation of electrocatalytic technologies relies on the development of electrocatalysts with high intrinsic activity. Intrinsic activity is the product of the steady state surface coverage of reaction intermediates and their surface lifetimes. Unfortunately, no method currently exists for measuring either of these critical parameters. However, these parameters are routinely measured in thermal catalytic science using steady state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA). SSITKA involves reaching steady state in a catalytic reactor and then rapidly changing the isotopic composition of the reacting species. The catalyst surface is covered by reaction intermediates derived from the initial reactant at the moment of this isotopic switch. The steady state surface coverage of these intermediates is measured by quantifying the total number of product molecules evolved from the catalyst surface with the initial reactant isotopic composition after the switch has been performed. Additionally, their surface lifetimes are quantified by fitting the decaying rate of formation of these products to an exponential function. While SSITKA has been performed for thermal catalytic systems for decades, it has never been applied to electrocatalytic systems until now. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) is an analytical technique that interfaces an electrochemical reactor to a mass spectrometer using a pervaporation membrane. This configuration enables volatile electrochemical reaction products to be continuously collected, identified, and quantified in real time. Coating the electrocatalyst directly onto the pervaporation membrane increases both the product collection efficiency and time response. This presentation will describe our efforts to perform electrochemical SSITKA (eSSITKA) for the first time.The insights obtained using this technique will be leveraged to explain the origins of many electrocatalytic phenomonon, such as the cation dependent activity of electrochemical CO2reduction.",

Cyclic voltammograms suggest the presence of subsurface hydrogen on Pd/C, while no subsurface hydrogen peak was observed for Pd foil. In addition to metal-support interaction, the presence of different crystal facets of pallidum makes it complicated to answer: (i) What is the structure of the active phase for these Pd-based catalysts? (ii) How do subsurface hydrogen coverage and surface geometry impact the overall reaction energetics?In this presentation, we will share DFT calculations of detailed reaction energetics for possible elementary steps involved in theccMA ECH tot2HDA,t3HDA, and AA on β-PdH0.16(111), β-PdH0.20­(533), and Pd(111) and Pd(533) with varying amounts of subsurface H*. The presence of subsurface hydrogen generally reduces ΔG for the first hydrogenation step by ~0.10 eV. The effect of the β-PdHxphase onccMA ECH is sensitive to the surface geometry and subsurface H* coverage. Overall, reaction free energies for surface-mediated ECH are correlated to the binding strength of reactants, which enables us to comment on designing electrodes for tuning selectivity.References:1.

    "abstract": "AbstractMethane (CH4) is the second-most abundant greenhouse gas with a warming potential 25 times as great as carbon dioxide. Short-term action plans directed toward diminishing the effects of global warming should therefore include mitigation of methane emissions. Direct capture of stranded methane emitted from relatively intractable sources with irregular emission patterns like livestock for subsequent large-scale industrial processing faces severe economic challenges. On-site treatment of CH4via catalyzed steam reforming (SMR) in mobile, dynamically operated modular reactors can overcome the economic barriers of capturing stranded CH4.Recently, researchers at the Center for Programmable Energy Catalysis (CPEC) have showed that the interdependence of the binding energies of surface intermediates can be leveraged to enhance the catalyst turnover beyond the Sabatier limit by several orders of magnitude for a relatively simple model reaction. Practically, modulation of intermediate energies can be achieved using the electron condenser, a novel device that periodically changes the electron density at the catalyst surface via applied potentials in a programmable pattern. Energies of adsorbed intermediates at different surface charges (electron densities) were obtained by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Linear scaling relationships between the binding energies at different surface charges on ruthenium catalyst were identified. The charge-based scaling relations were validated with conventional metal-based relations in literature. Transition kinetic model was employed to simulate the resonance of reaction rate to dynamic change of binding energies of surface intermediates. We explored the theoretical potential of exceeding the Sabatier limit for SMR by modulating the binding energies as a square wave for a broad range of frequencies. The band of frequencies that corresponds to maximal rate enhancement is identified.",

    "abstract": "AbstractElectrochemical reduction of CO(2)to high value products offers an appealing route to store sustainable energy and make use of the chief greenhouse gas CO2. With the modest affinity of CO, Cu-based materials remain to be the most important electrocatalysts for producing valuable multi-carbon products. Many catalyst design works reported the tuned CO binding energy on Cu-based materials, while such claims were mainly based on computational results. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a reliable experimental technique for determining the CO binding energy of catalysts at CO(2)RR conditions.In this talk, we present several newly designed surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) cells to characterize the CO binding energy on Cu-based electrodes. We have, for the first time, characterized the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO adsorption at electrochemical conditions by developing a SEIRAS cell with controllable temperatures and revealed that the modest adsorption enthalpy of CO on dendritic Cu (Den Cu) could attribute to the competitive adsorption of CO and water. High-pressure SEIRAS measurement was also conducted to estimate the absolute coverage on Den Cu, leading to the evaluation of standard Gibbs free energy and entropy. To understand the impact of CO binding energy on CORR performance, the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on oxide-derived Cu was also estimated, suggesting that our temperature-controllable SEIRAS could distinguish the strong CO binding sites on different Cu catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA high local electric field can rearrange the electronic orbitals of chemical species and alter the electronic interactions between adsorbates and catalytic surfaces, which influences the thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanisms of (electro)catalytic reactions.1The local high electric field could be generated by the different charges between the metal complex molecule (i.e., metal phthalocyanines, MPc = CoPc, FePc, NiPc, and Pc) and the Cu metallic surface, and could further be enhanced by the electrode/electrolyte interfacial electric field.Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that all MPc molecules induce a strong confined electric field on the order of ~2 to 3 V/Å. The favorability of C-C coupling is linearly correlated to the confined electric field strength (Figure 1a) generated at the MPc/Cu interface. To validate our DFT predictions, we conformally coated a thin layer of MPc molecules on a Cu-based gas diffusion electrode and evaluated the related CO2RR performance in a flow cell electrolyzer using neutral electrolytes (Figure 1b). The CoPc/Cu electrode showed an ethylene selectivity of 72% from CO2reduction, exceeding the ethylene selectivity on bare Cu by two-fold. With the aid of in-situ spectroscopic analysis, we confirmed that the CoPc/Cu catalyst performs the best for C-C coupling as it induces the strongest confined interfacial electric field among all examined MPc/Cu catalysts, consistent with our DFT results (Figure 1c).3This project will advance the mechanism understanding at the organic-inorganic interface, accelerating the electrochemical CO2conversion to ethylene and beyond.",

    "abstract": "AbstractModelling renewable fuel production systems allows organizations to investigate the most effective aspects, while operating under optimal conditions. As a result, an innovative data simulation technique based on response surface methodology (RSM) is proposed as part of the design of experiments (DOE) to thoroughly investigate the effect of the various operating conditions. DOE is a statistical strategy that is used to improve a process plan, so that the comprehensive understanding of the mechanism that is gained can be used to optimise the process with the fewest possible series of experiments. It can be used to focus on the impact of different components simultaneously, as well as on the dynamic interaction between them, in a methodical manner. The aims of this paper were to explore the components that influence the production of olefins and paraffin wax in the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process and then optimise the key components using factorial design and RSM. The parameters evaluated were: hydrogen to carbon monoxide (H2:CO) ratio; reaction temperature; reaction pressure; gas speed GHSV. By employing multivariate DOE, the effect and the probable synergistic effect of these components were investigated simultaneously. Single and multicentre parameter optimisation was performed, and it was found that the maximum heavy hydrocarbon selectivity (C5+-C∞) and the least amount of methane selectivity (CH4) can be obtained under the following conditions: H2: CO = 1.9; T= 241°C P= 17,9 bar; GHSV= 1241h-1.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMachine learning (ML) and flow chemistry are rapidly emerging as powerful tools in chemical reaction engineering to optimize complex processes and reduce costs for materials and molecular discovery and development compared to conventional batch experimentation. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the use of ML to model and optimize complex systems. By analyzing large experimental datasets generated from in-house experiments, ML algorithms can rapidly identify patterns in high-dimensional reaction spaces, predict reaction outcomes, and optimize operating conditions.One of the primary applications of ML is in the development of predictive models. These models can be used to form a digital twin of the chemical reaction and predict process outcomes, allowing for conventional optimization techniques to be performed on the model, reducing the number of experiments needed to achieve a desired target, lowering the cost and time associated with experimental development.Flow chemistry is another powerful tool for reaction miniaturization and optimization that can reduce the time and cost associated with the discovery and development of chemical processes. Automated flow reactors can provide superior control over the reaction conditions, minimize human error, and intensify heat and mass transfer rates. Furthermore, automation can be used to perform in-line monitoring and characterization of reaction performance in real-time, providing feedback to adjust the reaction conditions and optimize the reaction.In this work, we present an autonomous flow chemistry lab, specifically designed for rapid exploration/exploitation of high temperature and pressure gas/liquid two-phase catalytic reactions. As a case study, we demonstrate the application of the developed autonomous flow chemistry lab towards accelerated development of rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of olefins. The automated reaction execution in flow, leveraged alongside the ML-based experimental selection algorithms, perform autonomous regioselectivity tuning and reaction optimization campaigns as well as developing a digital twin of the reaction forin silicostudies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe United States produces more than 24 billion gallons of wastewater per day. Treating this volume of wastewater requires more than 30 TW-hr of energy and are burdened by the production of 6 million dry tons of biosolids – an organic byproduct containing 5 times the needed energy to operate treatment facilities. A high-water content limits energy recovery to 15% of biosolids via incineration. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) offers a promising alternative to incineration for recovering the energy content of wastewater solids, thereby making wastewater treatment energy-neutral or even net energy-producing.HTL heats organic waste streams to 250-400 °C while maintaining a liquid water phase. After reaction times ranging from minutes to an hour, an energy-dense biocrude product is formed due to depolymerization and recombination reactions. HTL has yet to be commercialized because current technology is limited to approximately 40% carbon recovery as biocrude, with the rest of the carbon forming gases, a carbon-rich solid char, and aqueous soluble products. HTL proceeds via a complex network of covalent and radical reactions. In this study, we added hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant, exothermic reaction partner, and radical source to promote HTL. We find that the sub-stoichiometric addition of hydrogen peroxide boosts biocrude yields from 40% to 60% at optimal conditions of 300 °C and 10 min of reaction time, with a corresponding decrease in char yields from 10 to 5%. Interestingly, gas and aqueous phase yields are not affected by hydrogen peroxide addition. Similarly, the biocrude obtained from the hydrogen peroxide promoted HTL reaction has carbon and hydrogen content similar to that found under standard HTL conditions, indicating its suitability for upgrading to transportation fuel. Combining HTL with the hydrogen peroxide reaction promoter is a powerful new way to increase biocrude yields, decrease char yields, and pave the way for commercial deployment.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn its pre-combustion role as coolant, fuel in future high-speed aircraft will be expected to sustain temperatures and pressures as high as 600 °C and 100 atm. These conditions—supercritical for most hydrocarbons—will cause the fuel to undergo pyrolytic reactions that may lead to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)—precursors to fuel-line solids that can hinder the aircraft’s safe operation. Since temperature plays a major role in determining the nature of pyrolysis products, it is imperative to understand the temperature-dependent supercritical fuel pyrolysis behavior as well as determine the temperature-dependent global kinetic rate parameters—essential for predicting PAH product yields—under supercritical pyrolysis conditions.To this end, we have conducted supercritical pyrolysis experiments with the model fuel ethylcyclohexane—a cyclic-alkane component of jet fuels. The experiments are carried out in an isothermal, silica-lined stainless steel flow reactor at 94.6 atm, 133 sec, and at seven temperatures—held constant during each experiment—in the range of 500 ˚C to 570 ˚C. The resulting complex PAH product mixture is separated using two-dimensional high-pressure liquid chromatography and isomer-specifically identified and quantified using ultraviolet-visible diode-array and mass-spectrometric detection.The yields of the pyrolysis products are reported as functions of temperature, and the temperature-dependent experimental data is used to determine the temperature-dependent global kinetic rate parameters, apparent activation energyEapp(in kcal/mol) and apparent pre-exponential factorAapp(in s-1), which appear in the expression for the kinetic rate constant, k=Aappexp[-Eapp/RT]. For these determinations, it is assumed that the rate of production of each aromatic product is first-order in the concentration of ethylcyclohexane fuel. The derived global kinetic rate parameters are reported for each aromatic product and for PAH grouped by ring number. The predicted yields, calculated from these parameters, are then compared to those obtained from the experiments.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSupercritical water is a promising medium for reaction processes which can be used in future energy and manufacturing technologies. For systems operating near the critical point, parallel free-radical and ionic chemical reaction pathways can be active and are affected by mixture pH. While observed qualitatively in several studies, the complex balance and interaction of these dual reaction regimes in supercritical water is poorly understood.The objective of this work was to experimentally investigate the activation and effects of base-catalyzed ionic reactions during propane oxidation in supercritical water, and to utilize these observations to develop a chemical model which includes parallel free-radical and ionic reactions. Experiments were conducted in a constant volume reactor system at 375ºC, 220 and 400 bar, for residence times 8 to 30 minutes. Mixtures were composed of 0.1 to 0.4 % propane by vol., oxygen with equivalence ratio of 0.75, and the remainder water or 0.1M NaOH in water (pH ~13). The chemical kinetic model will be created by expanding an existing free-radical model for propane oxidation to include potential ionic reactions, with rates determined empirically via genetic optimization.Experimental results indicate that while addition of NaOH had a minimal effect on the rate of consumption of propane, it had a profound effect on the reaction products - which varied with pressure. For both pressures, the addition of NaOH significantly shifted reaction products away from alkanes/alkenes toward oxygenates (ethanol, methanol, acetone). These effects increased with pressure for ethanol and methanol as expected, but surprisingly decreased with pressure for acetone. Broadly, the oxygenate shift observed here is in agreement with previous studies of both decomposition and oxidation processes in near critical water, suggesting a common underlying mechanism. Model development is underway, and will focus on identification of various hypothetical ionic pathways and rates which will motivate future studies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is a promising approach for producing biofuels and value-added chemicals. Currently, the resultant bio-oil quality and diverse product distribution make it economically unfeasible. Biomass−plastics co-pyrolysis has the potential for producing high-quality bio-oils while addressing plastic waste management in an eco-friendly manner.The presence of plastics alters product distributions of cellulose pyrolysis, but there is still a knowledge gap in the molecular-level understanding of how plastics with different functional groups vary cellulose pyrolysis reaction kinetics. Our previous density functional theory (DFT) study elucidates a new reaction mechanism for cellulose activation induced by noncovalent interactions (NCIs).[1]It is therefore hypothesized that functional groups in molten plastics perturb the kinetics of cellulose pyrolysis by inducing NCIs. To test this hypothesis, binary co-pyrolysis experiments of cellulose with polyethylene, polystyrene, polyethylene glycol, and polyketone were conducted following the procedures in our previous work.[2]DFT calculations were performed to study reaction pathways of cellulose pyrolysis in the presence of propane, benzene, dimethyl ether, and acetone as surrogates for polyethylene, polystyrene, polyethylene glycol, and polyketone, respectively.The results demonstrate that the selectivity toward levoglucosan, glycolaldehyde, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural are enhanced by 15.6, 8.2, and 5.1 %, respectively, in the presence of polyketone, polyethylene glycol, or polystyrene compared to those in the presence of polyethylene. These changes in product distributions agree with DFT calculations, which reveal that the functional groups in molten plastics induce NCIs that perturb the geometries and partial charges of transition states. This perturbation creates transition-state (de-)stabilization, leading to catalytic or inhibitory effects. These findings could help in the design of molten plastics that act either as unconventional catalysts or inhibitors for selectivity improvement in biomass pyrolysis.References[1] F. Sakirler, H.-W.

Among thesebioproducts, bio-oil can be upgraded to produce biofuels as an alternative to crude oils. Plastic wastes caused serious issues on the environment. The buried plastic wastes leached poisonous chemicals to pollute soil and groundwater. The disposal of plastic wastes is difficult, and the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics can be a promising solution to address this issue. However, the design and process optimization of co-pyrolysis is challenging, due to the complexity of biomass and plastics. The fundamental understanding of reaction kinetics is essential for the commercialization of co-pyrolysis. A new scheme in which the classical kinetic model is combined with a machine learning method is proposed to provide comprehensive description on the co-pyrolysis. In the proposed combined scheme, a parallel-reaction kinetic model is developed as a knowledge-based model while an artificial-neural-network (ANN) machine learning model is built as an experience-based model. The combined scheme will provide thorough understanding on the co-pyrolysis, based on the knowledge and experience for the process.

    "abstract": "AbstractCatalytic upgrading is one of the viable ways to improve the quality of bio-oil, generated via pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. Recently, transition metal carbides attracted significant attention owing to their noble metal-like properties. Monometallic carbide, especially, Mo2C, showed promising results in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil-derived compounds. However, it results in a mixture of deoxygenated and saturated products resulting in unnecessary high consumption of H2. In this regard, bimetallic carbides have recently drawn much attention to selectively enhance the deoxygenation characteristics of monometallic carbides. In this work, a novel tungsten doped molybdenum carbide (MoWC), synthesized and characterized using theory and experiments is examined. This study investigated the HDO performance of the MoWC catalyst and compares it to that of its monometallic counterpart using six major compounds that constitute bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of real biomass: 5-HMF, Acetic acid, Guaiacol, Eugenol, Levoglucosan, Methyl glyoxal, and Vanillin. Furthermore, they encompass the vast majority of oxygen-containing functional groups present in bio-oil components. The generally accepted mechanism for HDO includes two major pathways: i) direct deoxygenation (DDO) and ii) hydrogenation–dehydration (HYD). The presence of oxophilic tungsten in MoWC significantly reduces the DDO barriers for different bond types, specifically Caryl– O /C – O /C = O bonds (Ebarriers= 4 - 60 kJ/mol) in comparison to the corresponding monometallic catalyst Mo2C, which is relatively less active, particularly for C = O bonds. We also examined the alternative route (HYD), and demonstrated that MoWC has a strong preference for DDO over HYD than Mo2C, widening the gap between the two competing pathways and reducing excessive hydrogen utilization. This work illustrates that MoWC catalyst could be potentially used for the HDO of real bio-oil mixture.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping sustainable and alternative energy is crucial to address the depletion of limited fossil resources and mitigate global warming. Hydrotreated vegetable oil, with similar structure to fossil fuels and ability to reduce carbon emissions, is considered as a potential alternative fuel.In this work, the hydrotreatment of soybean oil for green fuel was conducted by Ni-Fe bimetallic supported on zeolite Y catalysts, denoted as Ni-Fe/Y, that were successfully synthesized with incipient wetness impregnation method. Prior to the process of hydrotreatment, the Ni-Fe/Y catalyst was firstly activated in hydrogen atmosphere at 400°C to a reduced state, denoted as Ni-Fe(R)/Y. Hydrotreatment of soybean oil was performed using decalin as the solvent and various Ni-Fe(R)/Y catalysts in a semi-batch reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a temperature controller. Activated and spent catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, XPS, ICP-OES, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, and N2physisorption analyzer. The determination of yield and selectivity of the product was accomplished by GC-FID, while qualitative analyses were conducted using GC-MS and FT-IR. Figure 1 illustrates the yield of deoxygenated hydrocarbons from soybean oil hydrotreated at 300°C and 40 bar H2with Ni-Fe/Y catalysts on which the total loadings of Ni and Fe on zeolite Y were fixed at 30 wt% based on the mass of zeolite Y. Compared to the Ni monometallic catalysts, the Ni-Fe/Y(R) catalyst with a mass ratio of Ni/Fe at 4 exhibited superior catalysis in deoxygenation and gave the larger overall yield. Additionally, increasing the total metal loadings and the reaction temperature can accelerate the reaction rate of deoxygenation and cracking, respectively. As a result, the hydrotreatment of soybean oil by 28Ni-7Fe(R)/Y catalyst at 350°C and 40 bar H2resulted in the best degree of deoxygenation and the highest yield in short-chain hydrocarbons. The reusability of the catalyst was also discussed in this work.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCarbon capture, utilization, and storage are emerging technologies to effectively mitigate CO2emissions and advance Net Zero technologies. Biochar is regarded as one of the promising CO2capture materials. Agricultural waste/residue, a carbon-rich material, can be converted into biochar via several thermochemical pathways. However, different CO2capture applications require different biochar properties and hence different synthesis methods1. Ionic liquid (IL) solvents can be integrated into traditional thermochemical conversions of biomass to produce advanced porous carbonaceous materials2. Biomass is mixed into an IL solvent, and the mixture is treated under medium pressures and temperatures, which is similar to wet/hydrothermal carbonization of biomass. The main product is known as ionochar. This process, which is called ionothermal carbonization (ITC), has not been well explored for agricultural residues.ITC of agricultural waste was investigated at a fixed reaction temperature of 200 °C with IL solvents (e.g., ChCl, ChOH, and ChFeCl4). The ionochar produced was further impregnated with varying metals, such as Ca, Mg, and Al, and subsequently treated under nitrogen gas from 500 to 900 °C to obtain activated ionochar for CO2capture. IL solvents, impregnated metals, and treated temperatures were observed to significantly affect the properties of activated ionochar in terms of, for example, specific surface area and CO2uptake ability. The specified activated ionochar with overall best properties was further tested for CO2capture ability with synthetic powerplant flue gas. Our findings indicated that activated ionochar from agricultural waste can have valorization of CO2capture with low capital cost and good adsorption capacity.Reference1A. N. Shafawi, A. R.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe integration of nanostructured catalytic materials (such as, Pd) in microfiltration type functionalized membranes or creating metal-polymer composite membranes can create immense value in the area of pollutant remediation from water. Reductive processes with Pd containing catalyst in membranes require dilute hydrogen source for reductive dehalogenation. If one can produce hydrogen through photobacteria (near IR light) by converting waste organic acids to hydrogen, then we can integrate Pd-containing membranes for reductive degradation of water pollutants. The presentation will include: (a) Hydrogen generation byphoto-responsive bacteria (Rhodopseudomonaspalustris).We used NIR light sources and optically resonant gold-silica nanoparticles to increase light utilization of the bacteria to convert waste organic acids, such as acetic and maleic acids, to hydrogen (RSC Adv, 2019; Int. J. Hydrogen Energy, 2021). We demonstrated > 2.5 fold increases in hydrogen production when grown under a NIR source compared to a broad-band light source at equal light intensity (130 W/sqm). The use of the of the biohydrogen with functionaized membranes (PVDF-PAA-Pd, and Fe/Pd) containing Pd particles showed over 90% conversion of PCB-1 to biphenyl for water detoxification, indicating excellent hydrogenation reaction; (b) Use of composite membranes (porous Pd film on UF membrane for PCB degradation.Magnetron sputtering was used to deposit thin films of tantalum and MgPd alloy on top of polysulfone (PSf) membranes 100 nm thick (J. Mat. Res, 2021). A dealloying step in water removes the Mg component of the film creating a nanoporous (np) film of Pd. PCB’s were dechlorinated while permeated in a water solution under pressurization with 5% H2gas (remainder Argon). Over 60% of PCB-1 was degraded in solution with a single pass (under 4 bar pressure) through the composite membrane at 40 liter/m^2 h.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe transition metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of olefin functionality primarily occurs via the Langmuir Hinshelwood mechanism. The presence of solvents often tends to alter the conventional mechanism of hydrogenation, promoting alternate routes which are energetically more favorable.1,2In the present study, catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of trans,trans-muconic acid (TTMA) to adipic acid (AA) using Pd/C catalyst and formic acid as a hydrogen source at 70°C and autogenous pressure is explored in different solvents. Interestingly, 100% conversion with 82% selectivity to AA is observed in water in 2 hrs (Table 1). Very high conversion is observed in polar protic solvents such as ethanol and methanol as well (Table 1). However, in THF, the conversion is observed to reduce to half, and in cyclohexane, the conversion drops to 9% (Table 1). Further, water THF solvent mixtures at different ratios were used to probe the mechanism of the hydrogenation reaction. We hypothesize that the hydrogen bonded network of water molecules assist the hydrogen transfer to the C=C bond via a proton coupled electron transfer mechanism (PCET). A detailed mechanistic study is carried out by modeling the system in different solvents and reaction environments using DFT simulations. Figure 1. shows the most stable binding mode of TTMA on Pd(111) and Pd(100) surfaces. The adsorption energy, activation barriers, and reaction energies of elementary steps is observed to change significantly in the presence of explicit solvents applied in the simulations. We observe a favorable energetics for the proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism for the hydrogenation of muconic acid in protic solvents as compared to that of the conventional hydrogenation route.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFacile separation of complex mixtures via catalytic reactions has gained interest in industrial manufacturing. Specifically, the Zn2+system has been employed to purify α-β-bromoethylbenzene mixtures by selectively decomposing α-bromoethylbenzene (α-B). We have confirmed that the non-redox metal ion Zn2+facilitates the homolysis of the C–Br bond in halohydrocarbons with benzyl bromide, which significantly promotes the generation of free radicals. While anionic complex intermediate formation has been reported as the primary mechanism for radical production from azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) catalyzed by non-redox metal salts, which is not applicable to the Zn2+catalyzed decomposition of α-B.In this study, we used AIBN/BPO homolysis mediated by non-redox metal ions as a reference to examine the unique mechanism of Zn2+-catalyzed α-B decomposition. Kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of various Zn2+/Cu2+and AIBN/BPO/α-B combinations suggested that Zn2+-catalyzed α-B decomposition was not initiated by anion catalysis, contrary to previous reports. In situ Raman and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) revealed the activation and stretching of the C-Br bond in α-B when Zn2+ions were present, while a radical scavenger experiment suggested a chain mechanism. Liquid-phase X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and catalyst screening tests further confirmed that Zn2+-catalyzed α-B decomposition was a metal ion-dominated process leading to radical formation. We further extended the substrate scope to benzyl halides and allyl iodohydrocarbons and proposed this unprecedented mechanism which holds the potential to revolutionize fields such as polymerization.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWith their versatility, epoxide ring-opening reactions have played a crucial role in organic synthesis. For example, aliphatic epoxides can be utilized to prepare polyols, the building blocks of polyurethanes (PU), by undergoing epoxide ring-opening reactions.1, 2Epoxide ring-opening can produce two regio-isomers: a primary alcohol (P1) and a secondary alcohol (P2). For PU applications, P1 has enhanced reactivity with isocyanates and is much preferred to P2. Therefore, catalysts that provide better selectivity and rates to P1 are of great interest. To date, only B(C6F5)3(also known as BCF), favors P1 over P2.3-6Despite the utility of this catalyst, mechanisms for epoxide ring opening, catalyst speciation under reaction conditions, and catalyst decomposition pathways are all incompletely understood.11, 12We have previously established a model of epoxide ring-opening of epoxyoctane using a variety of alcohols as nucleophiles. Depending on reaction conditions, decomposition (protodeborylation) of BCF and isomerization of epoxide are side reactions that may occur, and thus, we expanded the model to encompass these additional reaction pathways. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to map reaction mechanisms and quantify thermodynamics and kinetics characterizing this complex reaction system. Gaussian 16 was used as the computational chemistry software for all calculations. Reaction energies were calculated at the B3LYP-D3BJ/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory.DFT calculations for the additional reaction pathways leveraged the mechanism for epoxide ring-opening by BCF that we previously unraveled, which revealed that additional hydrogen bond acceptors such as water and 1-propanol played an important role on both rate and regioselectivity. Incorporating reaction kinetics from DFT calculations into the expanded microkinetic model, we identified two key routes in BCF decomposition: direct hydrolysis/alcoholysis and proton-catalyzed hydrolysis/alcoholysis. Finally, the core reaction model was modified to establish a model for propylene oxide ring opening and its side reactions, including catalyst decomposition.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAtomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as a powerful tool for the precise design and synthesis of catalytic materials at the atomic level. One approach to tuning reaction selectivities and increasing catalyst stability involves depositing an oxide layer over the active metal using ALD to block highly active and non-selective catalytic sites while at the same time preventing sintering of the metal nanoparticles. Rh/TiO2catalysts can potentially benefit from this strategy, since they are highly active hydrogenation catalysts, but their selectivity in the hyperpolarization of allyl acetate from parahydrogen remains low demonstrated in our previous paper.1Induction of strong metal-support interactions (SMSIs) resulting in TiOxmigration over the Rh particles has been shown to improve pairwise addition of parahydrogen to propylene to yield hyperpolarized propane with significant NMR signal enhancement (Figure 1a). However, the TiOxmigration via SMSIs cannot be precisely controlled. To carefully control the growth of oxide on the Rh particles, 50 ALD cycles using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water vapor were applied to create a core-shell structure with Al2O3covering Rh nanoparticles on the TiO2support (Figure 1b). The Al2O3layer decreased the propylene conversion to propane (Figure 1c) and is expected to improve the pairwise selectivity of hydrogenation of propargyl and vinyl esters in solution. In addition, the Al2O3layer is expected to stabilize the Rh nanoparticles against Rh leaching into solution, which can pave the way for utilizing these catalysts in liquid phase reactions to synthesize hyperpolarized metabolites such as acetate and pyruvate for in-vivo MRI use.(1) Zhao, T.

However, there are important limitations in the accuracy and range of applicability of the available models in literature. A promising alternative for advancing the knowledge of the local holdup distributions in bubble columns is found in the application of Machine Learning techniques; nevertheless, up to these days there are no developed Neural Networks for the prediction of local gas holdups in bubble columns, and particularly radial profiles. In a great extent, the main drawback preventing the application of these techniques in previous years was the availability of a large enough databank of local gas holdup experimental measurements. Advances over the last decades in measurement techniques have allowed to have enough data reported in literature to gather a significative databank for these models’ development. In this work, a new databank containing 1252 experimental points was gathered and used for the development of a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The new DNN allowed a highly accurate prediction of the local gas holdup profiles, exhibiting a Mean Squared Error 0.001. Furthermore, the DNN allowed to estimate the single and multi-feature effects of the operation conditions, geometrical characteristics, and physical properties of the fluids, over the local gas holdup profiles",

MoVNbTeOxcatalyst is the most active catalyst in the ODHE process, which is usually prepared by hydrothermal method and sensitive to the synthesis procedure. The synthesis of MoVNbTeOxoxide is remain time-consuming, which limits its accessibility on a large scale. In this work, the synthesis parameters of MoVNbTeOxcatalysts were optimized and screened by laboratory scale batch autoclave reactor and tubular reactor e.g., precursors compositions, synthesis temperatures, and time durations. The optimized synthesis parameters were adopted for the continuous flow hydrothermal synthesis (CFHTS) of MoVNbTeOxby a microtubular coil reactor in a short time duration. The gas generated divides the liquid inside the tube into droplets, intensifying the internal mass and heat transfer processes and allowing for catalysts with excellent catalytic performance and reproducibility. Compare with the catalysts synthesized by conventional laboratory-scale autoclave reactors, the CFHTS method with higher synthesis temperature can significantly reduce the synthesis time, which can reduce the synthesis time duration from ~ 48 h to 10 min.",

These functional groups are responsible for the high activity and selectivity of enzymes. In this work, we demonstrate the role of bound organic ligands in determining the stability, number of active sites, and catalytic activity of gold nanoparticle catalysts. A series of gold nanoparticles is synthesized using bulky phosphine and thiol ligands which impart stability to the nanoparticles which are less than 2 nm in diameter. 2-napthalenethiol titrations are used to measure the number of binding sites on the Au nanoparticle surfaces. The Au nanoparticles stabilized by bis(diphenylphosphino)methane produced the highest accessibility where 61% of the total gold atoms bind 2-napthalenethiol. This represents the highest fraction reported for an organic ligand-stabilized metallic nanoparticle in solution. The Au nanoparticles synthesized with phosphine ligands are all active for resazurin reduction and the reaction rate scales with the number of binding sites on the nanoparticle surface.Triphenylphosphine (TPP)-stabilized Au nanoparticles are compared to triphenylmethyl mercaptan (TPMT)-stabilized Au nanoparticles in three different reactions: benzyl alcohol oxidation, CO oxidation, and resazurin reduction. The nanoparticles are similarly sized and have a similar number of sites accessible to 2-napthalenethiol. The catalytic activities of the TPP- and TPMT-stabilized Au nanoparticles are similar for benzyl alcohol oxidation and CO oxidation. However, when the TPP- and TPMT-stabilized Au nanoparticles are used in resazurin reduction, the TPP-stabilized nanoparticles are active while the TPMT-stabilized nanoparticles are in active. It is hypothesized that this difference in activity, which is not due to differences in nanoparticle size or number of active sites, originates in electronic differences of the Au nanoparticles surfaces as measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and FTIR of bound CO molecules.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLight olefins, specifically C2to C4olefins, are essential building blocks for a variety of chemicals, including polymers, pharmaceuticals, and solvents. Conventionally, these olefins are primarily obtained through the catalytic cracking of large alkanes at high temperatures and the dehydrogenation of light alkanes found in natural gas. However, with dwindling oil reserves, there is a pressing need for alternative methods of light olefin production. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) offers a viable way to produce light olefins by utilizing synthesis gas (syngas). To optimize the FTS process, it is crucial to precisely control the affinities of carbon and hydrogen on the catalyst surface, promoting C-C coupling for olefin products while preventing over-hydrogenation and methane formation. Additionally, it is vital to regulate the activation of CO on the catalyst surface to minimize CO2production.In this study, a series of alumina-supported In-promoted Fe catalysts (with Fe:In loading ratios of 20:1, 10:1, and 20:3) were examined to determine how to control catalytic activity and selectivity during syngas conversion to light olefins. Pure Fe metal on alumina was also studied for comparison. The In-promoted Fe catalyst (10 mol % In based on Fe) demonstrated high selectivity (45% including CO2) and remarkable stability (72-hour run) in converting syngas (2:1 H2/CO ratio) to olefins, with a 10% CO conversion at 400°C and 5 bar. The results suggest that the ensemble size of Fe sites, catalyst surface reactivity, and surface Fe electronic structure can be systematically adjusted as a function of Fe:In loading ratios. These findings are supported by performance studies, in-situ CO temperature programmed desorption (TPD) studies, XPS analysis, and Steady State Isotopic Transient Kinetic Analysis (SSITKA). Indium-promoted iron catalysts hold potential for facilitating efficient syngas conversion, derived from biogas and landfill gas reforming, into olefins, offering a sustainable alternative to crude oil cracking.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGreenhouse gases, such as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), contribute to climate change, therefore reducing their effects has become a crucial challenge. Dry reforming of methane (DRM) can convert CH4and CO2to synthetic gas, but catalyst deactivation limits the process. In catalysis, nickel represents an ideal candidate as cheaper alternative to noble metals, but it suffers from coke formation and sintering at high temperatures. Using appropriate support and preparation methods play a major role in improving the activity and stability of Ni supported catalysts. For example, surface treatment of natural clays such as halloysites is one of the strategies explored to enhance nickel catalyst stability. In this study, halloysite nanotubular (HNT) clay is utilized as a support for Ni deposition. Here, efforts are made to activate the surface of HNT with acids (HNO3and H2SO4) and alkalis (Na2CO3+ NaNO3and NaOH) prior to Ni doping to assess the effect of support treatment on the stability, and activity of the catalyst. 10 wt% Ni catalysts on raw, acid, and alkali treated-HNT supports were prepared via the wet impregnation method. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, BET surface area, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photo electron spectroscopy, H2-Temperature Programmed Reduction, CO2-Temperature Programed Desorption, and Temperature Programmed Oxidation. The catalyst morphology, chemical structure, and performance testing of the developed catalysts are presented. Ni doped NaOH-treated HNT showed a more than 2-fold increase in surface area (SA > 115 m2/g) compared to Ni-raw and Ni-HNO3treated HNT, with small Ni nanoparticle size (9 nm) and uniform distribution. In addition, it yielded higher basic sites and stronger Ni interaction, resulting in more stable catalyst compared to acid treatment with conversions (> 90%) and minimal coke formations. HNT could be an effective support for Ni catalysts in DRM reactions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOrganic monolayers have been shown to be useful surface modifiers for controlling catalyst selectivity, but they often result in substantially lower reaction rates due to their high surface densities. In this work, an ion-exchange technique was employed to generate a low-density SAM coated catalyst capable of improving selectivity based on geometric effects with significantly higher activity compared to a full monolayer due to reduced site-blocking. Multiple characterization techniques including DRIFTS, ICP-OES, and CO chemisorption provided evidence for successful deposition of a homogeneous SAM layer at approximately 1/3rdof the coverage of a full monolayer. Catalyst performance was tested using benzyl alcohol hydrogenation. A drastic reduction in activity was observed for a full monolayer catalyst compared to unmodified Pt/Al2O3, which was attributed to significant site-blocking. However, toluene selectivity increased, likely due to steric interactions. CO DRIFTS data suggested low amounts of contiguous metal sites due to the ligands. As a result, reactant adsorption onto Pt was restricted to an upright configuration where hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) producing toluene is favored while flat-lying adsorption was limited, resulting in less decarbonylation and ring hydrogenation. The low-density SAM catalyst showed similar improvements in selectivity with drastically increased activity. The low-density SAM used in this study paired well with benzyl alcohol, but SAM density and gap size could presumably be tailored to target other reactions as a potential strategy for size-selective reaction control.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCatalytic treatment of chlorinated contaminants, also known as hydrodechlorination (HDC), is considered to be an effective technique for the removal of these compounds from water. Chlorophenol (4CP) is one such contaminant, formed due to the reaction of phenolics with chlorine, which is used as a disinfectant in water. Experimental studies show that chlorophenol dechlorinates to form phenol over a Pd catalyst. Phenol further undergoes hydrogenation to form cyclohexanone or cyclohexanol. The chlorine atom thus released results in strong binding to the Pd surface and hence, deactivation of the catalyst. Moreover, in our recent study, we have observed relatively easy removal of chlorine as HCl from the terrace sites as compared to the step or corrugated sites owing to lower activation barriers over Pd (100) and Pd (111) surfaces. In the present study, the mechanistic insights into the HDC reaction of 4CP over Pd (111) facet is obtained with periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations as built in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 6.2.0) and used by our group in prior studies. 4CP binds with an energy of -165 kJ/mol on the Pd (111) surface (Figure (i)). It undergoes dechlorination followed by hydrogen addition to form phenol. In addition, bimetallic catalysts tend to show higher activity compared to the monometallic Pd. Thus, we have made an attempt to design bimetallic catalysts with coinage metals (Cu, Ag and Au) and understand the HDC of 4CP over these formulations. Further, this data is utilized to build a microkinetic model (MKM) to estimate the trends in activity (in terms of turnover frequency (Figure (ii))) and selectivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIntermetallic compounds, composed of two or more metals, possess long-range crystallographic order (i.e., well defined site occupancy) with distinct differences in catalytic behavior from their parent metals. Relating the observed catalytic kinetics to active site structure and composition is a significant challenge in the field. We have recently shown Pd-Zn γ-brass (Pd8+xZn44-x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 2) has tunable active site nuclearity, exposing monomers and/or trimers of Pd in a Zn matrix, with the ratio of monomers to trimers set by stoichiometry. The limited co-adsorption configurations available on monomer and trimer sites allow DFT to fully enumerate all possible coverage scenarios. Catalytic testing demonstrates monomers are inactive and trimers are active for ethylene hydrogenation. For stoichiometries, such as Pd9Zn43which expose both monomers and trimers, the hydrogen order decreases and ethylene order increases with increasing temperature. A microkinetic model informed by both DFT calculations and experimental results reveals hydrogen adsorption and dissociation on the central atom of the trimer as the rate determining step. The model also uncovers the role of monomer sites in supplying H atoms to the trimer sites via surface diffusion, leading to the temperature dependence of the reaction orders. In systems with no monomers present (Pd10Zn42), reaction orders show no dependence on temperature over the range tested. The γ-brass structure can also accommodate coinage metals by replacing the central Pd atom of the trimer, creating Pd-M-Pd sites. When M = Cu, the increased barrier of hydrogen dissociation on copper relative to Pd causes non-monotonic dependence of the reaction orders on temperature, revealing a delicate interplay between the short-range (Cu in trimer) and long-range (Pd monomer) H-atom supply. This work demonstrates the power of DFT and microkinetic models to uncover subtle details in reaction mechanisms on well-defined, isolated reaction sites, when informed by rigorous experimental measurements.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSingle atom late transition metal catalysts, supported on reducible metal oxides, can show activity and remarkable selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. Our previous work has demonstrated that the metal atoms (i.e., Ag) are largely responsible for hydrogen activation facilitating metal oxide (i.e., TiO­2­) reduction, while hydrogenation elementary steps occur on the partially reduced oxide1. Although significant literature exists on hydrogenation mechanisms on extended metal clusters, elementary reaction mechanisms and the role of metal-oxide sites in hydrogenation remain an open area of research. Theoretical and experimental studies have identified and characterized spillover hydrogen on the surface of these catalysts, namely hydrides in oxygen vacancy defect sites which may be involved in C-H bond formation1,2. We report a hydride-facilitated mechanism that guides our understanding of how C-H bonds form on reducible metal oxide-based catalysts.We use density functional theory calculations to examine the co-adsorption of hydride species in oxygen vacancy sites, together with monoanionic ligands such as halides, alkyl, and phenyl-type groups. We demonstrate that C-H formation can proceed from this hydride co-adsorbed state, providing a kinetically feasible mechanism from a thermodynamically stable precursor. We introduce case studies of how hydride addition with negatively charged aromatic ligands such as benzoate to generalize how C-H bond formation may occur on TiO2-supported single atom catalysts. Moreover, we investigate how the reduction of TiO2in the form of oxygen vacancies and Ce-atom doping can facilitate these hydride addition mechanisms. Finally, we propose generalized trends and rational design principles that link the electronic behavior of these metal oxide catalysts and their potential for favorable hydride-ligand bond formation to occur.(1) Hu, J. et al.,J.

    "abstract": "AbstractBiofuels are a promising alternative to fossil fuels because of their abundant supply and net carbon-neutral byproducts. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is used to produce biofuels by eliminating oxygen from bio-oils derived from lignocellulosic biomass. However, it is critical to utilize catalysts that can efficiently use costly hydrogen during HDO. The design of HDO catalysts is challenging because of the complex interplay between factors such as adsorbate coverage, temperature, pressure, and crystal structure. Many theoretical studies concentrate on low coverages, and the findings for adsorbates with significant lateral interactions deviate from the reality of near-saturation coverages. To address these challenges, a multi-scale modeling approach involving density functional theory and microkinetic models was used to investigate the coverage-dependent adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen (adsorbates representative of many surface species during HDO) on Pt and Ni nanoparticles (Figure 1). The coverage-dependent adsorption energies of O* and H* on multiple facets showed that both species experienced repulsive interactions, with (111) having the strongest repulsions due to the tightly packed nature of the facet. These adsorption energies were parameterized via mean-field polynomial models, revealing that O* has nearly twice the repulsive adsorbate-adsorbate interactions as H*. By approximating multi-faceted nanoparticles as paraboloids, we calculated the equilibrium coverages of O* and H* over Pt and Ni nanoparticles at various temperatures and pressures. For H*, the predicted coverages with and without adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are nearly identical, indicating that H* sees very weak lateral interactions. For O*, the difference in predicted coverages for both cases shows the importance of accounting for nanoscale effects in correctly modeling catalyst materials. Overall, the study establishes an approach to capturing the contributions of adsorbate-surface and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions simultaneously over multi-faceted nanoparticles. The strong influence of lateral interactions on adsorbate coverages highlights the importance of accurately accounting for nanoscale effects in modeling catalyst materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDirect H2O2synthesis from H2and O2provides a green route to produce H2O2. Pd has been widely used for this process, although its commercialization is limited due to low H2O2yields.1This study aims to systemically assess the impacts of Pd-O coordination and particle sizes on primary H2O2selectivities and H2O2decomposition reactivities. Density functional theory (DFT) methods are implemented to calculate the rate constant ratios forH2O2formation (via OOH* reduction; kO-H) and OOH* decomposition (via O-O cleavage; kO-O) for metallic Pd, surface oxide, and bulk oxide models. The kO-H/kO-Oratio is much smaller for Pd13than for Pd(111) (10-10vs. 10-4at 300 K), indicating poorer primaryH2O2selectivities for smaller particles. Yet, this ratio remained much smaller than unity for all Pd models. As the oxygen chemical potential increases, the Pd-Pd ensemble sites are perturbed by O atoms, which dramatically change their selectivities. The kO-H/kO-Oratio increased from 10-4, 109to 1016as Pd(111) oxidizes to Pd5O4/Pd(111) and PdO(100). This selectivity improvement, however, is very structure sensitive and the improvement remained minimal for surfaces that persistently contain Pd-Pd ensembles, such as PdO(101)/Pd(100) and PdO(101). Smaller PdO nanoparticles do not contain these facets and thus fully benefit from the selective enhancement. DFT-derived energy trends show that the catalysts with higher primary H2O2selectivity are also less prone to H2O2decomposition, leading to high H2O2yields. Furthermore,ab initiothermodynamics calculations are used to assess the relevant Pd phase inO2and H2O2/H2O environments, revealing that smaller Pd nanoparticles are likely to present as PdO during H2O2decomposition experiments. This study highlights how Pd transformation to PdO impacts H2O2synthesis and decomposition rates and selectivities, which are sensitive to the Pd-O coordination environments and particle sizes.ReferencesFlaherty, D.W.ACS Catal2018,8(2),1520–1527.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLate transition metal nanoparticles supported on high surface area materials catalysts are essential in many industrial chemical production processes and promising for new and emerging applications. Understanding fundamental structure-function relationships of nanoparticle catalysts on support materials informs efficient catalyst design and provides benchmarks for computational predictions. We directly measure metal adsorption energies and metal atom chemical potential on model catalyst supports via single crystal adsorption calorimetry (SCAC) to gain information about the interactions between the catalyst supports and metal nanoparticles. Previous metal/support systems studied in this way have provided insights into the fundamental behavior of catalysts and correlations of catalyst behavior with metal chemical potential. Metal/support adhesion energies allow estimating this chemical potential versus particle size on different supports, and thus provide information on reactivity and sintering resistance of metal nanoparticles. Linear correlations between the oxophilicity of metals and their adhesion energy to MgO(100) and CeO2(111) have been demonstrated. The adhesion energy of Ag to rutile-TiO2(100) has been previously measured. Here, we expand upon the existing oxide adhesion energy trends with new SCAC measurements of Cu on rutile-TiO2(100). The new oxide correlation gives insight into the relationship between the oxide support and the adhesion energy, to predict adhesion energies across oxide surfaces. We also extend adhesion energy measurements to carbon surfaces with new SCAC results for Pd nanoparticles on single-layer graphene supported on Ni(111). Combined with previous measurements of Ni and Ag on graphene/Ni(111), we find that these adhesion energies to graphene scale linearly with metal carbophilicity, which we define as the DFT bond energy of one C atom to the (111) face of that metal. This trend suggests the adhesion energies of other late transition metals to graphene films on Ni(111).",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe chemical industry has been one of the major contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. Many of these industrial processes require heating of volumetric reaction media to high temperatures, with applications ranging from the pollutants capture to production of chemicals. One solution to mitigating these carbon emissions is to utilize renewable and clean electricity, instead of fossil fuels, to provide endothermic heat. Amongst the wide range of electrification heating concepts, inductive heating(IH) is an established method for efficient, and rapid heating. However, an underlying challenge is understanding how IH can be adapted to heat volumetric media uniformly and its integration with different reactor configurations. An extensive understanding of the design of heating susceptors, catalyst integration with susceptor, and co-design of power electronics are required.We present a highly efficient inductively heated reactor system tailored for CO2capture from flue gas. The system design involves the placement of a metallic open cell lattice susceptor together with carbonate-based sorbent. CO2capture is mediated by operating the reactor in a fluidized bed mode, in which carbonate-bicarbonate chemistry is used to selectively capture CO2. To regenerate the sorbent and release high purity CO2, a temperature swing is applied by inductively heating the susceptor. Due to the large surface area-to-volume ratio of the susceptor, heat transfer between the susceptor and sorbent is achieved with minimized temperature gradients and fast heating rates. Energy transfer efficiency from the power electronics (I.e., board and magnetic coil) to the susceptor was tuned and optimized by employing a novel high frequency (~ MHz scale) power circuit and coil design. Desired volumetric heating profiles spanning the full reactor width were achieved by co-designing the power electronics and susceptor such that magnetic induction and Eddy current dissipation occurred throughout the reactor volume. In experimental demonstrations, we showcased electricity-to-heat conversion efficiencies of over 90%.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSolar-driven CO2reduction (CO2R) holds great promise for the sustainable generation of energy-dense fuels and chemicals. Multicarbon (C2+) products are particularly attractive because they have a large market size and can be further converted to higher molecular weight hydrocarbons fuels. Metallic Cu has the unique ability to catalyze CO2to C2+products with high faradaic efficiency; however, the product distribution of CO2R on Cu is potential-dependent. To achieve selective PEC CO2R to C2+products, the potential at which C2+product formation is maximized, referred to here as Vid, needs to be attained. To obtain a sufficiently high photovoltage for operation near Vid, a photoelectrode with two or three semiconductors of different bandgaps in a multijunction stack is required. The photovoltage and photocurrent depends on the exact combination of bandgaps in the multijunction stack. In addition, Vidwill depend on the overall device architecture because various overpotentials shift Vid.This talk will present a continuum model of PEC CO2R and will explore the codesign of the photoelectrode bandgaps and device architecture for the generation of C2+products. The simulation results demonstrate the critical importance of simultaneously engineering the photoelectrode and device design in order to ensure the photovoltage and photocurrent from the photoelectrode enables operation at the device-specific Vid. Modifying the device design will require a change in operating potential in order to ensure the system operates at the new Vid, which can be achieved by changing all the bandgaps in the multijunction stack by approximately the same amount. In addition, the model predicts that photoelectrodes with a high photocurrent and photovoltage near Vidare required to achieve high solar-to-C2+efficiency throughout the diurnal and annual solar cycles. This insight is critical for the design of monolithic, unassisted PEC CO2R systems which yield high solar-to-C2+efficiency.",

Direct non-oxidative methane dehydroaromatization in microwave(mw)-assisted reactor is one of the promising conventional processes for excellent product selectivity and less severe operating conditions.A dynamic, non-isothermal, multi-scale model of a MW-assisted fixed-bed reactor has been recently developed. The model includes a detailed sub-model for inter and intra-particle mass transfer and a reaction kinetic model including coke formation and catalyst deactivation. A comprehensive heat transfer model has been developed considering heat transfer between metal sites, support sites and the gas with catalyst particles and between bulk and catalyst particles. MW absorption by both metal and support sites area is considered. Maxwell’s equations are used for modeling MW penetration into catalyst particles.Considerable improvement has been made in our in-house MW-assisted reactor by substantially increasing the product yield and reducing coke yield. The new laboratory data are reconciled for satisfying mass and atom balance by developing a dynamic data reconciliation approach. Reconciled data are used to estimate parameters for kinetic model. Lab-scaled reactor model is scaled up to commercial scale reactor and plantwide-model is set up with appropriate separation steps for efficient product recovery.Economic analysis of the process is undertaken by exporting the plantwide-model developed in AspenPlus to Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. Capital costs and efficiency of MW reactor are estimated based on in-house data. Operating costs are evaluated based on results from the plantwide-model while cost of the catalyst and its replacement schedule are estimated based on in-house data. Economics of the MW-assisted process are compared with conventional multi-step natural gas-to-aromatics production process via methanol synthesis. Impact of various economic and process parameters on key economic measures such as IRR and NPV is studied.

    "abstract": "AbstractNatural gas flaring is a cheap method to process the stranded natural gas due to limited pipeline takeaway capacity. However, flaring is not only a significant waste of domestic resources but also produces significant greenhouse gas emissions. Converting the excess natural gas to value-added chemicals is a way to monetize this wasted resource. Zeolite-based catalysts are widely applied to this direct conversion process. An integrated microwave catalyst system has been demonstrated to be capable of C-H bond activation for direct methane conversion. However, the microwave sensitivity of the zeolite is poor, therefore, a microwave absorber like silicon carbide (SiC), either in the form of particles additive or monolith, offers a viable way to enhance microwave heating. This study presents a computational perspective of the performance of the SiC microwave absorber in proximity to the zeolite catalyst in two different configurations, 1) SiC and catalyst powders co-mixed and 2) catalyst poured in the channels of the SiC monolith, and discusses the influence of the observed reaction performance in the microwave reactor.The results show that a catalyst-filled SiC monolith structure provides a more homogeneous heating pattern under the same power setting compared to catalyst-SiC powder mixture case. However, the monolith wall creates more than 30% of electric field decay per monolith channel, which affects the potential activation of the intermediates triggered by the moderate electric field intensity. Coking is the biggest causes of catalyst deactivation. It is observed experimentally that the catalyst deactivation rate is higher in the microwave reactor. The numerical simulation results show that the existence of coke will significantly and negatively affect the electric field strength around the catalyst.Since coke is a good microwave absorber, the coke absorbs microwave energy quickly and causes temperature overshot of the catalyst bed, which results in damage to the zeolite structure.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is integral to many electrochemical transformations, including those involved in fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Oxygen reduction can also occur in chemical catalytic transformations and has been ascribed to a metal-mediated electrochemical path or a redox mediator-mediated chemical path. The coupling-decoupling of the independent half-cell reactions depends on the active catalyst, substrates, applied potential, and other reaction conditions (pH). Despite these recent advances, the intricate elementary processes involved in different chemical and electrochemical routes for these mediated ORR transformations are still vague. First-principles calculations have been carried out herein to provide atomic-level insights into the possible chemical and electrochemical pathways involved in O2reduction over earth-abundant metal and nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N-C) catalysts (M= Co, Fe). The complexity of the catalyst-liquid interfaces has been captured with a fully explicit treatment of the reactants, catalysts, and solvent molecules. Potential-dependent ab initio molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations are used to elucidate redox mediator-mediated reactions overcoming the kinetic limitations of the separate electrochemical pathways at lower anodic overpotentials. At lower anodic overpotentials, the redox mediator couples a proton-electron transfer step for ORR. However, two catalyst-mediated individual electrochemical half-cell reactions occur on these M-N-C catalysts at higher anodic overpotentials. While the source and sink of the proton and electron remain the same, the pathway and hence the rates are tuned by the applied potential. Two electron-two proton transfer pathways leading to either the formation of H2O2or water using benzoquinone as a probe mediator have been investigated over both Co- and Fe-based M-N-C catalysts. These insights can be extended to develop further transformations involving redox mediators and obtain the best of both heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis approaches.",

These pathways contain a combination of electron transfer and purely chemical elementary steps, leading to a complex reaction network.

Here, we explore interplay of thermal and electrochemical reaction mechanisms in controlling the partial or total oxidation of ethanol and methane.The partial oxidation of ethanol to form ethylene oxide is achieved using a chloride mediated pathway where kinetic control must be used to promotechlorination at the β-carbon while suppressing the thermodynamically more favorable chlorination at the α-carbon. Our experiments show that the selectivity to 2-chloroethanol is significantly impacted by the temperature and applied potential.We also use electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS) to facilitate the development of methane partial oxidation catalysts. We investigated the reaction pathway that leads to the undesirable formation of CO2in the competitive total oxidation and found that this pathway results from the transformation of surface intermediates to *CO which must be avoided in the pursuit of methane partial oxidation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRenewed interest in the use of perovskite oxides as catalysts towards oxygen related electrochemical transformations has led to the need for identification of robust design criteria to tune their performance.1,2The existing paradigm for describing the activity of perovskite oxides often relies on the averaged oxidation state of the transition metal, which fails to comprehensively describe their activity.1Further, these design strategies rarely describe their stability.Consequently, development of rigorous design criteria, using measurable properties of working, non-model oxides which can shed light on their activity and stability remains an open challenge.Herein, an approach to correlate experimentally measurable oxide properties (i.e., oxide surface reducibility) with their electrocatalytic activity and stability is developed.2,3This is demonstrated for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).We show that the oxide surface reducibility (EVO), which describes the strength of the transition metal-lattice oxygen bond, captures effects from both the oxide composition and crystal symmetry, on the binding energetics of oxygenated intermediates, and consequently their ORR activity.EVOis estimated empirically on working oxides using H2-temperature programmed reduction studies, which exhibits a volcano type relationship with the empirically measured ORR activity.3A correlation between EVOand the stability of these oxides is also found, making this descriptor comprehensive in describing the overall performance of perovskite oxides.3Extension of this descriptor towards predicting their performance for oxygen evolution reaction will be discussed.4These insights open avenues for engineering active and stable cationic centers in complex oxides for targeted reaction chemistries.References(1)Gu, X-K.; Samira, S.; Nikolla, E.Chem.

    "abstract": "AbstractExternal electric fields can modify binding energies of reactive surface species and enhance catalytic performance of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions. Large electric fields can be experimentally generated through three ways: (1) internally over molecular length scales in (metallo-)enzyme and zeolite catalytic active sites; (2) externally in gas/solid heterogeneous catalytic system, such as ultra-high vacuum conditions via scanning tunneling microscopy, field ion/emission microscopy, or flow reactor type via dielectric barrier discharge, coaxial capacitor, and microwave reactor; and (3) in an interfacial way at gas/liquid/solid triple phase boundary.Compared to experimental studies, theoretical work on electric field effects in catalysis is very limited due to the low efficiency of pure DFT calculations for predicting field-dependent energetics of catalytic reactions. This has led to an incomplete picture of how electric fields influence catalytic mechanisms at the atomic-scale and hinders the design and optimization of field-induced catalytic technologies.To address this gap, we designed a novel deep learning framework for predicting the field-dependent adsorption energies. Specially, we employed a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture the relationship among the geometries, followed by a shared multiple-layer perception (MLP) for field-induced catalytic reaction prediction. The deep learning algorithm developed here accelerates field-dependent energy predictions with acceptable accuracies by five orders of magnitudes compared to DFT alone and has the capacity of transferability, which can predict field-dependent energetics of other catalytic surfaces with high quality performance using little training data (Figure 1).1Our designed deep learning framework can provide potential good catalyst candidates for field-induced heterogeneous catalysis in a short time. By this means, some unacceptable catalyst candidates can be quickly filtered out, thus avoiding the unnecessary computations.ReferenceM. Wan, H. Yue, J. Notarangelo, H. Liu, F.

    "abstract": "AbstractSelective oxidation of biomass-derived chemicals is a route to key intermediates for a range of products. Given the high relative oxygen content of many biomass-based chemicals, discovering effective catalysts for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alcohols and aldehydes is an active research area.Applying the important platform chemical hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as a model reactant, containing both alcohols and aldehydes, we discovered the ODH rate was dramatically enhanced (2.4 times) upon placing spatially separated Au and Pd nanoparticles (i.e., physical mixture, Au@Pd/C) onto electronically connected supports, compared to rates from sum of monometallic catalysts (Au/C and Pd/C). Our understanding of this enhancement lies in considering the overall ODH reaction as two coupled half-reactions; dehydrogenation (DH) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We propose that this rate enhancement is due to electrochemically coupling between Au/C selectively performing DH and Pd/C selectively performing ORR. This proposed mechanism, which we term cooperative redox coupling enhancement (CORE), is studied utilizing standard electrochemical approaches.Electrochemical HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and ORR tests revealed that Au/C has an excellent HMFOR and poor ORR activity. In contrast, Pd/C showed an excellent ORR and poor HMFOR activity. Therefore, the overall thermocatlytic HMFOR activity of the Au@Pd/C can be significantly enhanced by electrochemical redox coupling of Au/C (HMFOR) and Pd/C (ORR), as observed in the thermocatalytic test. The electrochemical coupling was confirmed by monitoring the short-circuit current flow from Au/C to Pd/C in a dual-chamber electrochemical cell. The CORE effect supports an evident relationship between the aqueous-phase ODH of alcohols and aldehydes and the corresponding electrochemical half reactions. Furthermore, the CORE effect implies the electrochemical understanding of thermocatalytic reactions can enable the designing of effective thermocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHydroformylation (thermo-HFN) is an industrially important reaction that couples olefins and carbon monoxide (CO) to make aldehydes. If thermo-HFN were electrified to use protons and electrons instead of hydrogen gas, such an electrochemical hydroformylation (electro-HFN) reaction could be useful in the context of electrified chemicals manufacturing for functionalizing abundant olefins to synthetically versatile aldehydes. Additionally, electro-HFN could provide a method for sequentially elongating carbon chains in the context of electrochemical CO2-to-fuels conversion. However, electro-HFN represents a complex C–C bond-forming reaction that is difficult to achieve at heterogeneous electrocatalysts. In this work, we import Rh-based thermo-HFN catalysts onto electrode surfaces to unlock electro-HFN reactivity. At mild conditions of room temperature and 5 bar CO, we achieve Faradaic efficiencies of up to 15% and turnover frequencies of up to 0.7 hr-1. This electro-HFN rate is an order of magnitude greater than the corresponding thermo-HFN rate at the same catalyst, temperature, and pressure. Reaction kinetics suggest that in electro-HFN, protons and electrons directly participate in a non-mediated, electrochemical reaction pathway that is distinct from thermo-HFN and proceeds more readily at mild conditions.Operandox-ray absorption spectroscopy shows the catalyst consists pentacoordinate Rh(III) during catalysis. Most generally, this work demonstrates an experimental strategy for electrifying a well-studied thermochemical reaction to expose a new electrocatalyst for a difficult and underexplored electrochemical reaction.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHeterogeneous catalysts consisting of iron cations incorporated into nitrogen-doped carbon (“Fe-N-C”) have received extensive attention as leading alternatives to Pt for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and additionally catalyze the thermal oxidation of organic molecules with O2as the oxidant. Fe-N-C catalysts host mononuclear nitrogen-ligated active centers, FeNx, that frequently coexist with agglomerated Fe species. Although FeNxare the dominant active centers for ORR electrocatalysis and many aerobic oxidations, the accuracies of methods to quantify them are still debated. Here, we develop a kinetic probe-reaction approach to quantify FeNxcenters and compare it with spectroscopic and probe-molecular methods.Initial rates of the aerobic oxidation of a water-soluble hydroquinone (HQ) were measured under kinetically controlled and mechanistically well-defined conditions (303 K, 50 mM HQ, 1.1 atm O2, 0.5 M aqueous H2SO4). Fe-N-C catalysts were synthesized to contain mononuclear FeNxspecies at low loadings (0.1–0.4 wt% bulk Fe) on solvent-accessible surfaces using a postsynthetic metalation approach and their Fe speciation was confirmed by low-temperature57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. The HQ oxidation rate (rHQ, per gcatalyst) catalyzed by these well-defined materials correlates linearly with the density of FeNxcenters (NFeNx), reflecting their intrinsic HQ oxidation turnover frequency (TOFFeNx). Assuming negligible contributions to rHQfrom other Fe species, HQ oxidation was evaluated as a kinetic probe to estimate the density of FeNxspecies (NFeNx= rHQ/ TOFFeNx) in a suite of Fe-N-C catalysts with diverse synthetic origins and Fe speciation (0.3–8.4 wt% bulk Fe). Kinetically determined FeNxsite densities are compared with those estimated by low-temperature57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, pulse CO chemisorption, and electrochemical stripping of NO derived from NO2−. Kinetic quantifications of FeNxcenters correlate well with probe-molecular methods and do not require pretreatments that may alter active-site distributions or specialized equipment, offering an attractive complementary approach.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMany important reaction systems involve quite complicated reaction networks. In the past the kinetics were usually modeled by empirical fits (e.g. to power law models). But now it is becoming practical to compute thermochemistry and rates for thousands of reaction intermediates using quantum chemistry, and these large data sets can be used to train fast models for predicting a range of molecular and reaction properties. This suggests one could build kinetic models a priori, before doing experiments, and also use model structures with much higher fidelity to the true underlying chemistry. However, building, checking, and using these complicated models introduces a number of new challenges. In this talk we report some of our recent work on overcoming these challenges, including automated workflows for computing sensitive Keq’s and k(T)’s using quantum chemistry, methods for coupling reaction and transport, methods for handling macromolecules, training models using a mix of quantum and experimental data, and methods for estimating solvent effects.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn recent years, there has been rapid advancement of applying artificial intelligence to organic synthesis planning. In this work, we developed and applied a computational framework based on a template library-based approach to search for novel pathways that lead to defined molecules of interest. The foundation of the framework is automated network generation using our in-house code Pickaxe-Generic, where user-curated reaction rules are recursively applied to the input molecules and their products to create a reaction network comprised of all possible reactions and intermediates. 183 reaction rules that cover a wide range of reactions were curated by hand from organic chemistry literature. The rules are labeled and contain carefully selected auxiliary atoms to ensure the accuracy of the reaction prediction, while generalized enough to apply to all reactants with the targeted moiety. Tests were conducted against available chemical reaction datasets, including the USPTO-50k[1], and our rules reproduced the majority of the recorded reactions.Several strategies were applied to overcome the combinatorial explosion issue during network expansion. The computational capacity of the maximum number of steps in pathways was doubled by combining the forward and retrosynthesis network. Once all possible pathways were identified, they were evaluated by selected ranking factors. Further assessments can then be carried out on the top ranked pathways to produce the final synthesis plan.

    "abstract": "AbstractHydroformylation converts alkenes, in the presence of syngas (CO + H2), into aldehydes with an additional carbon atom and remains the largest homogeneously catalyzed process industrially. As homogeneous catalysis is associated with several disadvantages, such as difficult catalyst separation and recycling, the development of heterogeneous hydroformylation catalysts, e.g., via immobilization of the homogeneous variant on a solid support, is currently a hot topic. In this respect, ethylene hydroformylation has been experimentally investigated on a Metal Organic Framework (MOF) catalyst functionalized with ligand-modified Rh coordination centers and via microkinetic modelling. The reaction proceeds in the gas phase, allowing for continuous reactor operation with no solvent. At the maximum performance, ethylene conversions of 90% and propanal selectivities of 99% were obtained simultaneously, with ethane as the side-product, and the catalyst has shown stability after 10 days of time-on-stream. The microkinetic model accounted for Wilkinson’s dissociative mechanism, see Figure 1.a, which is widely-accepted for homogeneously catalyzed hydroformylation, to which a hydrogenation pathway was added. The model was regressed to the experimental data, which led to significant model parameter estimates, i.e., the activation energies and reaction enthalpies of the considered elementary steps. The ethylene conversions and propanal selectivities were well-reproduced by the model, see Figure 1.b and Figure 1.c. Activation energies around 80 kJ mol-1were estimated for ethylene insertion and ethane reductive elimination, respectively. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the most kinetically relevant steps of the hydroformylation pathway were ethylene insertion, hydrogen oxidative addition and propanal reductive elimination, while ethane reductive elimination was essentially rate-determining in the hydrogenation pathway. As the experimentally obtained product spectrum is very similar and the same kinetically relevant elementary steps were identified as in the homogeneously catalyzed hydroformylation in our previous work, it can be concluded that there are major similarities between the reaction mechanisms on both catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIntramolecular catalysis (IntraCat) is the acceleration of a process at one site of a molecule catalyzed by a functional group in the same molecule. Here, we report a novelIntraCatmechanism involving intramolecular catalytic transfer of hydrogen atoms, when a reactive part of a molecule (chat-catalyst moiety or chat-agent, which may include peroxyl, carboxyl, and other ambivalent H-donor/acceptor groups) catalyzes an interconversion process, for instance, keto-enol tautomerization and cyclization in the same molecule, while recovering itself. In contrast to traditionalIntraCatprocesses, however, CHAT is a unimolecular catalysis since the process occurs within a single molecule with no external agent being involved.The CHAT bond-exchange mechanism can be regarded as an intramolecular version of the intermolecular relay transfer of H-atoms, which is mediated by a separate molecule (molecular catalyst), e.g., dihydrogen, water, various inorganic and carboxylic acids. A general systematization of such processes has been proposed earlier, as illustrated in the simplest case of the H2-mediated processes termed dihydrogen catalysis [1]. Following this systematization, the CHAT catalysis is assigned to the category of relay-transfer of H-atoms.Here, we provide a characteristic example of the chat-catalysis reactions involving keto-enol tautomerization of the pentane 2,4-ketohydroperoxide - a key intermediate in combustion of common hydrocarbon fuels, based on first-principles modeling and potential energy surface analyses. A significant reduction of the H-transfer barrier (by nearly a factor of 2) occurs due to the decreased ring strain in the transition state. The enol product is shown to feasibly decompose to form H2O2- a mid-temperature chain branching agent.The rate parameters for the model reaction are calculated and implemented in a kinetic model to analyze its influence upon global combustion characteristics.Asatryan, E.

    "abstract": "AbstractOut-of-equilibrium electrochemical reaction mechanisms are notoriously difficult to characterize. However, such reactions are critical for a range of technological applications. For instance, in metal-ion batteries, spontaneous electrolyte degradation controls electrode passivation and battery cycle life. Here, to improve on our ability to elucidate electrochemical reactivity, we combine computational chemical reaction network (CRN) analysis based on density functional theory (DFT) and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) to study gas evolution from a model Mg-ion battery electrolyte — magnesium bistriflimide (Mg(TFSI)2) dissolved in diglyme (G2). Automated CRN analysis allows for the facile interpretation of DEMS data, revealing H2O, C2H4, and CH3OH as major products of G2 decomposition. These findings are further explained by identifying elementary mechanisms using DFT. While TFSI–is reactive at Mg electrodes, we find that its decomposition does not meaningfully contribute to gas evolution. The combined theoretical-experimental approach developed here provides a means to elucidate electrolyte reactivity, improving our ability to predict decomposition products and pathways when initially unknown.",

However, currently, the catalyst design for CO2RR-to-C3+is very limited because (1) no pure metal catalyst could energy-efficiently convert CO2to C3+fuels; (2) the reaction mechanism is unknown.According to previous work about long-chain hydrocarbons formation,1the alloy system with palladium and gold presents excellent catalysis performance for C3-C5products with CO2RR. We then designed a PdAu bimetallic catalyst (Figure 1a) as a study case and explored the mechanism of CO2RR-to-C3+via a combination of machine learning, density functional theory (DFT) and microkinetic modeling.3In particular,our results show that Cn-C­H2coupling is more energetically favorable than Cn-CO. This further confirmed our hypothesis that to generate C3+fuels, the reaction mechanism is a Ficher-Tropsch-like synthesis which passes by the key intermediate CH2. The reaction energetics could be further promoted at the Pd-Au interfacial site as compared to the pure Pd or Au sites. For the future work, we will design a deep active learning algorithm to auto-generate and auto-select bimetallic interface sites for CO2RR to long-chain hydrocarbon fuel generation.This theoretical research provides an innovative reaction mechanism, i.e., CH2insertion, for bimetallic system based CO2RR to long-chain hydrocarbons (C3+).

    "abstract": "AbstractSelective catalytic reduction with ammonia (NH3-SCR) is one of the effective strategies for treating NOxfrom the vehicular exhaust.1The redox properties of the catalyst are crucial in determining the NH3-SCR reaction mechanism and kinetics. This investigation is focused on modelling and analysing the NH3-SCR reaction on single-atom Mo on Fe2O3catalyst using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to understand the influence of its acid-redox properties on the reaction mechanisms and kinetics. Single-atom Mo on Fe2O3catalyst was modelled based on experimental data available in the literature.2Specifically, a single Mo atom is substituted on the top and sub-surface layer of the α-Fe2O3(001)surface. The optimised catalyst model with sub-surface layer Mo substitution containing one H on the surface oxygen had geometric features in agreement with reported X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) data. Furthermore, Bader charge analysis showed that the oxidation state of Mo was 4.85, which is consistent with the experimental value.2Ab initiothermodynamics analyses predicted that the oxygen-rich state of Mo on α-Fe2O3(001) surface is the most stable in an oxygen environment representative of vehicle exhaust gas. On the Mo on α-Fe2O3(001) catalyst, potential reaction pathways such as those involving NO oxidation and those involving oxidative dehydrogenation of NH3were investigated. In the pathway involving oxidative dehydrogenation of NH3to form NH2, NO is preferentially adsorbed on the Fe sites adjacent to the Mo atom, which facilitates the easy coupling and formation of an NH2NO intermediate with NH2. This intermediate undergoes dehydrogenation to form an NHNO intermediate, which further undergoes intramolecular H transfer to form N2and OH without the concomitant formation of N2O. This sequence of reactions ultimately enhances the N2selectivity. In routes involving NO oxidation to NO2, the NH2-NO2coupling step is unfavorable and N2O is a surface intermediate and a potential byproduct.",
